Official Plan

Adopted by Council Dec. 10, 2012 
Approved by Bruce County: March 26, 2014 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
The Official Plan is a general land use guide, the purpose of which is to guide land use 
decisions and manage change in the Town. In accordance with the Planning Act, an 
Official Plan shall contain, “goals, objectives and policies established primarily to 
manage and direct physical change and the effect on the social, economic and natural 
environment of the municipality.” 
The Planning Act requires local policies to be consistent with policy statements issued 
by the Province, such as the Provincial Policy Statement, 2005. The Provincial Policy 
Statement provides direction on matters of Provincial interest related to land use 
planning. The Official Plan is also required to conform to the policies of the County of 
Bruce Official Plan. 
 
STRUCTURE OF THE PLAN 
 
The Official Plan is divided into 6 Sections, each of which is described in the following 
Sections: 
Section 1 (Vision, Goals and Objectives) contains the Vision of the Town. This Vision 
is based on an understanding of past and future trends and the wishes of the Town’s 
residents. The goals and objectives that form the basis of the Plan support the Vision. 
These goals and objectives also establish a framework for the remaining policies in the 
Plan. 
Section 2 (General Development Policies) contains policies that apply to the entire 
Settlement Area and provide general guidelines that will be considered when reviewing 
development and planning applications. 
Section 3 (Settlement Area Policies) contains specific policies that apply to the various 
land use designations within the Town as set out on Schedule A. 
Section 4 (Transportation) contains the policies that address, roads and transportation, 
trails and corridors and the Airport. 
Section 5 (Servicing and Utilities) contains policies that address sewage and water 
servicing, stormwater management and drainage and utility policies. 
Section 6 (Implementation and Plan Administration) describes how the Vision, 
Goals, Objectives and Policies of the Official Plan will be implemented. 
The policies of this Official Plan are also implemented on the following Schedules: 
Schedule A 
Land Use 
Schedule B 
Transportation 
Schedule C 
Built-up and Greenfield Area 
Schedule D

HOW TO READ THIS PLAN 
 
The Plan should be read in its entirety in all instances. When determining the policies 
that apply to a given property, the following steps should be undertaken: 
1. 
The property should be located on Schedule A to determine the applicable 
designation. 
 
2. 
The property should be located on Schedule B and Schedule C to determine the 
classification of road that services the property and whether the property is in the 
Built-up Area or the Greenfield Area. 
 
3. 
The policies of the applicable designation should be reviewed. The policies that 
reflect the land use designations identified on Schedule A are found in Section 3 
of this Plan. 
 
4. 
Section 2 - General Policies, Section 4 - Transportation, Section 5 - Servicing 
and Utilities and Section 6 - Implementation, apply to all areas subject to this 
Plan. 
 
5. 
The property should be located on Schedule D to determine whether the property 
is within a Source Water Protection area. 
 
The Official Plan applies to all lands in the Settlement Area of Saugeen Shores including 
publicly owned lands. Landowners, developers, and all users of this Plan should read all 
of the relevant policies as if they are cross-referenced with each other. This is a 
comprehensive document and while specific policies sometimes refer to other policies, 
these cross-references do not take away from the need to read this Plan in its entirety. 
In addition to the policies of this Plan, the policies of the County of Bruce Official Plan 
and the Provincial Policy Statement shall be considered. 
Development for the purposes of this Plan means the creation of a new lot, a change in 
land use, or the construction of buildings and structures, requiring approvals under the 
Planning Act including but not limited to: consents, minor variances, zoning 
amendments, official plan amendments, plans of subdivision, plans of condominium 
deeming by-laws and site plan control agreements. 
NATIVE LAND CLAIMS 
 
The Chippewas of the Saugeen First Nation and the Chippewas of Nawash First Nation 
have filed a Native Land Claim for the islands in the Saugeen River, the lands that 
border the north side of the Saugeen River and the shoreline from the mouth of the 
Saugeen River northerly around the Bruce Peninsula. This Official Plan is not to be 
interpreted as influencing the Native Land Claims.

Environmental features include habitat of endangered or threatened species, 
significant wildlife habitat, wetlands, significant valleylands, areas of natural 
and scientific interest, significant woodlands and fish habitat. The protection 
of environmental features is important to the local economy as the tourism 
industry is dependent upon the health of the natural environment. 
Additionally, the general health of the population benefits from clean air, 
clean water and the biodiversity that is maintained by protecting and 
enhancing environmental features. 
2.6.1.2 
Until such time when environmental features mapping is available and is 
incorporated into this Plan, this Plan will rely on the Environmental Hazard 
designation, Special Policy Area #4, and the Significant Woodlands Study 
mapping to achieve much of the Town’s environmental goals and objectives. 
New development proposed in or adjacent to the Environmental Hazard 
designation must also address all of the applicable environmental features 
issues. 
2.6.2

2.6.7 
Areas Of Natural And Scientific Interest 
 
2.6.7.1 
Areas of Natural and Scientific Interest (ANSIs) are areas of land and water 
that represent significant geological (earth science) and biological (life 
science) features. Earth science ANSIs include areas that contain examples 
of rock, fossil and landform features in Ontario. Life science ANSIs are areas 
that contain examples of the many natural landscapes, communities, plants 
and animals. 
2.6.7.2 
Development shall not be permitted in a Life Science ANSI. Development 
may be permitted adjacent to a Life Science ANSI and on or adjacent to an 
Earth Science ANSI subject to the preparation of an Environmental Impact 
Statement and confirmation that the proposed development will have no 
negative impacts on the natural features or their ecological functions. 
2.6.8 
Tree Preservation and Significant Woodlands 
 
2.6.8.1 
“Significant Woodlands” refer to areas occupied by trees, woodlots or forests 
that provide important environmental and ecological functions. 
The 
woodlands, in addition to being important habitat to the biological community, 
provide an important balance in the distribution of open space and passive 
recreation within an urban setting. 
2.6.8.2 
This Plan promotes the maintenance, restoration and enhancement of the 
woodland areas of Saugeen Shores. The woodland areas are described as: 
a) lands within ‘Special Policy Area 4’ as identified on Schedule ‘A’ to this 
Plan; b) lands subject to the Town of Saugeen Shores Significant Woodlands 
Review, as identified on Schedule ‘A’ to this Plan as the ‘Significant 
Woodlands Overlay’; c) woodlands that have an area of 4 hectares (10 acres) 
or greater that are not identified on Schedule ‘A’ to this Plan. 
a) Section 3.20 contains policies for lands within ‘Special Policy Area 4’; 
other woodlands policies within Section 2.6.8 do not apply to lands within 
‘SPA 4’. 
b) Section 2.6.8 contains policies for lands subject to the Significant 
Woodlands Review.

c) Woodlands having an area of 4 hectares (10 acres) or greater are 
considered “significant woodlands”; development or site alteration shall 
not be permitted within these woodlands. Development may be permitted 
on adjacent lands in accordance with Section 2.6.11. Certain lands within 
the Significant Woodlands Review are also part of woodlands that have 
an area of 4 hectares (10 acres) or greater; in such cases, development 
or site alteration may be permitted subject to the policies of this Section. 
2.6.8.3 
Significant woodlands within the Significant Woodlands Review were 
identified based on woodland size, size of woodland interior, proximity to 
other woodlands and known natural heritage features, strength of existing 
linkages, and presence of significant vegetation communities or species. As 
identified in the Significant Woodlands Review, the interior of the woodlands 
is defined as a continuous area of 2 hectares or greater and is measured 100 
metres from the edge of the woodland feature. 
2.6.8.4 
Primarily these lands comprise a small portion of a larger wooded feature 
along the Lake Huron shoreline that runs north. It is recognized that a small 
portion of the significant woodland is within the designated Settlement Area 
that has been serviced with municipal sewer and water and other municipal 
services. Many of the lands within this area are designated as Residential 
and the lands are required to meet the Town’s growth projection in Section 
1.2 of this Plan. The objective is to therefore permit new development in 
accordance with the underlying designation, in a way that protects and 
maintains interior woodland features and values. 
2.6.8.5 
Development and site alteration shall not be permitted in these significant 
woodlands unless it has been demonstrated through the preparation of an 
Environmental Impact Statement that interior woodland features and values 
are retained. 
2.6.8.6 
Development in the interior shall be discouraged. If developments are 
proposed within interior areas, the proponent shall be required to undertake 
an Environmental Impact Study. The contents of the Environmental Impact 
Study shall be determined through pre-consultation with the Town and SVCA. 
For developments adjacent to the ‘Significant Woodlands Overlay’ or in non- 
interior areas, an Environmental Impact Statement may be required. 
Standard mitigation measures and remediation tools shall be applied, such 
as: 
 
a) 
Tree preservation and retention plans with the objectives of minimizing 
tree removal and disturbance, and protecting vegetation communities of 
conservation concern, and that consider clustering built form techniques; 
 
b) 
Re-planting plans that incorporate appropriate native species. Re- 
planting shall occur either on the land subject to development or on other 
lands within or near the significant woodland feature. The ratio of new

Natural Features Linkages 
 
2.6.9.1 
It is the policy of this Plan to identify and improve linkages between natural 
heritage features. Linkages provide important pathways for local species 
movement between habitat areas. 
2.6.9.2 
Linkages are generally comprised of vegetative corridors and are often 
associated with water features. The Town shall encourage the use of Site 
Plan Control and site specific zoning to protect and develop linkages between 
natural features of the Town. 
2.6.10 
Source Water Protection 
 
2.6.10.1 
The Saugeen, Grey Sauble, Northern Bruce Peninsula Source Protection 
Plan was approved in 2015 in accordance with the Ontario Clean Water Act, 
2006.  The purpose of the Source Protection Plan is to protect existing and 
future sources of drinking water for municipal residential drinking water 
systems.  The source protection plan identifies vulnerable areas for the 
protection of drinking water sources: municipal Wellhead Protection Areas 
(WHPA) and Intake Protection Zones (IPZ), as well as Highly Vulnerable 
Aquifers (HVA) and Significant Groundwater Recharge Areas (SGRA). 
 
The Source Protection Plan identifies that Municipalities are responsible for, 
among other things, using planning tools to manage risks from significant 
drinking water threats.  It is the objective of this Town of Saugeen Shores 
Official Plan to: 
 
a) Support the implementation of Saugeen, Grey Sauble, Northern Bruce

b) Protect existing and future sources of drinking water for future use;   
 
c) Incorporate source protection objectives into the land use planning 
process to ensure that existing and future drinking water resources are 
not compromised in the future as a result of land use decisions; 
 
d) Encourage the establishment of water conservation measures as a way to 
meet water supply needs; 
 
e) Ensure the protection of drinking water sources by recognizing vulnerable 
areas such as intake protection zones, significant groundwater recharge 
areas, highly vulnerable aquifers as well as event-based areas and by 
controlling development within these zones that are deemed to pose a 
significant threat to the quality or quantity of the drinking water sources. 
2.6.10.2 
The Zoning By-law shall identify land uses that are not permitted within areas 
of Source Water Protection. 
2.6.10.3 
At present time, the majority of residents within the urban areas of Port Elgin 
and Southampton obtain their drinking water through a municipally owned 
water system, which receives its supply from Lake Huron through an intake 
located off of Southampton. 
Schedule D-1 to this Plan identifies the Southampton Drinking Water Intake 
Protection Zone. 
Schedule D-2 identifies the Southampton Drinking Water Intake Events 
Based Area. Within Events Based Areas EBA-13,000 and EBA-22,5000 as 
delineated within the approved Saugeen, Grey Sauble, Northern Bruce 
Peninsula Source Protection Plan and shown in Schedule D-2 to this Plan.

Environmental Review Policies 
 
2.6.12.1 
It is a policy of the Town to require land use proposals within and/or abutting 
lands designated as Environmental Hazard to be reviewed by Council and 
appropriate government agencies in order to ensure that development which 
has the potential to seriously impair ecological processes and natural 
features by virtue of the type and scale of the proposed land use or the 
cumulative impacts of it and other land uses in its vicinity is not permitted 
within the Plan area. The Environmental Impact Statement shall assist in 
determining whether the development should be permitted, and if so, what 
environmental safeguards shall be necessary. 
2.6.12.2 
Depending on the scale, intensity and type of development proposed, a 
number of environmental studies, as determined by the Town or various 
government agencies, may be required at the proponent’s cost prior to the

HAZARD POLICIES 
 
2.8.1 
Introduction 
 
2.8.1.1 
It is a goal of this Plan to direct development away from hazardous areas, 
such as floodplains, steep and unstable slopes, organic and unstable soils, 
erosion susceptible areas, as well as flooding, erosion and dynamic beach 
hazards associated with Lake Huron. These natural hazards may be severe 
enough to cause property damage and may pose a risk to public health 
and/or safety if the lands were to be developed. In addition to those lands 
designated as Environmental Hazard, the following policies apply to lands 
that exhibit hazardous characteristics. 
 
2.8.2 
General Policies 
 
2.8.2.1 
Within all lands designated Environmental Hazard, development and site 
alteration shall be prohibited or restricted. 
 
2.8.3 
Lands Prone to Watercourse Flooding 
 
2.8.3.1 
Lands prone to watercourse flooding are defined as those lands adjoining a 
river, channel or stream that are susceptible to flooding during the Hurricane 
Hazel Flood Event Standard (formerly known as the Regional Storm flood). 
Specific policies for these areas are found in Section 3.18 of this Plan. 
 
2.8.4 
Lands Prone to Lake Huron Flooding and Erosion 
 
2.8.4.1 
Lands prone to Lake Huron flooding and erosion include an area measured 
15 metres landward from the 100 Year Lake Flood Line, which includes an 
allowance for wave uprush, erosion and other water related hazards. In 
particular locations along the shoreline, a dynamic beach hazard exists. 
Specific policies for these areas are found in Section 3.18.4.2 of this Plan. 
 
2.8.5 
Steep and Unstable Slopes and Areas Susceptible to Erosion 
 
2.8.5.1 
Lands prone to steep and unstable slopes and erosion are defined as those 
lands adjacent to slopes and located within the 100 year erosion rate and/or 
the stable slope allowance. Development should be set back an appropriate 
distance from the top of bank, as determined by the Saugeen Valley 
Conservation Authority. An increased or reduced setback from the top of 
bank may be considered if a technical study is completed to the satisfaction 
of the Saugeen Valley Conservation Authority. 
 
2.8.5.2 
The Zoning By-law may define steep slopes and may establish minimum 
setback requirements from steep slopes.

LAND USE COMPATIBILITY 
 
2.9.1 
The proposed development and redevelopment of all land in the Town must 
generally be compatible with adjacent land uses. Residential areas and other 
sensitive land uses shall be protected from undesirable air quality and 
excessive noise and vibration through the policies of this Plan and the use of 
Site Plan Control. 
2.9.2 
Developers proposing to locate residential or other sensitive land uses near 
industry, airports, arterial roads and/or provincial highways or new 
commercial or industrial development proposed in proximity to existing 
residential development may be required to carry out noise, air quality and/or 
vibration assessments and determine control measures which are 
satisfactory to the Ministry of Environment and/or the Town and which meet 
the Ministry's recommended sound, air quality and vibration limits. 
2.9.3 
The Town may use Site Plan Control, and the implementing Zoning By-law, 
to require buffering between uses of land where there may be conflicts such 
that one use may detract from the enjoyment and functioning of the adjoining 
use. Such buffering will be considered in light of the Ministry of Environment’s 
guideline entitled “Guideline D-6 Compatibility Between Industrial Facilities 
and Sensitive Land Uses”, as amended from time to time, and may include 
landscaping, screening and the separation of uses by extra distance between 
them. 
2.9.4 
Added conditions such as increased yard requirements, planting strips, 
fencing, and/or berms, deflective lighting, are all added requirements that 
may be imposed to offset aspects of incompatibility between any two land 
uses as may be set out in the implementing Zoning By-law. 
2.10 
MOBILE HOMES/TRAILERS 
 
2.10.1 
Mobile homes and trailers shall not be permitted except in accordance with 
the policies of Section 3.4.4 of this Plan. 
2.10.2

SHORELINE RESIDENTIAL DESIGNATION 
 
3.7.1 
Purpose 
 
3.7.1.1 
The Shoreline Residential designation applies to the predominantly 
residential and cottage residential area along the Lake Huron Shoreline. 
Some of the lands designated Shoreline Residential are fully serviced with 
municipal sewage and water services, other area lands are partially serviced. 
Lands in the Shoreline Residential designation have historically been 
recognized primarily as a cottage area. Many cottages in the designation 
have been converted to year round use. The designation is distinguished 
from the “Residential” designation for the purposes of the Plan because 
development in the shoreline area will require additional assessments in 
accordance with Section 6.3.4. 
3.7.2 
Objectives 
 
3.7.2.1 
To maintain the character of the built form in the Shoreline Residential 
designation including housing style, height, density and massing. 
3.7.2.2 
To provide limited opportunities for low density housing that can be 
appropriately serviced. 
3.7.2.3 
To direct any developments greater than 5 lots/units to locations in the 
Residential designation, which have available municipal sewer and water 
capacity. 
3.7.2.4 
To preserve and enhance the natural visual quality of lake and river 
environments. 
3.7.2.5 
To preserve and enhance the natural environment of areas in proximity to the 
shoreline and river environments including fish and wildlife habitat. 
3.7.3 
Permitted Uses 
 
3.7.3.1 
The predominant use of lands shall be for detached residential Residential 
Unit or Buildings, both seasonal and permanent. 
3.7.3.2 
Existing commercial uses, housekeeping cottages and cabin rental 
establishments are recognized as permitted uses, however the establishment 
of new operations shall require a Planning Report and a Settlement 
Capability Study. 
3.7.4 
General Policies 
 
3.7.4.1 
Development of Existing Lots 
3.7.4.1.1 
A number of vacant residential lots exist within the Shoreline Residential 
designation. Some lots were created prior to any formalized planning and do 
not comply with the residential lot standards of the current Zoning By-law. 
Development of existing under-sized vacant lots may occur subject to the 
Mod # 40 
Town of Saugeen Shores 
Official Plan 
50 
Adopted by Council Dec. 10, 2012 
Approved by Bruce County: March 26, 2014 
 
following criteria: 
a) it has been demonstrated that the lot size and physical conditions can be 
appropriately serviced; 
 
b) the Town is satisfied that all issues regarding Municipal services have 
been addressed; 
 
c) the property is zoned to outline minimum standards that are appropriate 
for the lot; 
 
d) the property is located on a road that is maintained year round by the 
Town or an agreement has been registered on the title of the property to 
confirm suitable access to the property; and, 
 
e) as a condition to development, the Town may require the registration of a 
Site Plan Agreement on title of the lands, addressing issues such as 
Municipal service provision and road access. 
 
3.7.4.2 
Protecting the Character of Shoreline Areas 
3.7.4.2.1 
New development in the Shoreline Residential designation shall be designed 
to minimize the visual impact of buildings and structures on shoreline areas. 
Depending on the scale of the development, a Visual Impact Assessment 
may be required to demonstrate how the development will be designed to 
ensure that height, bulk, density and massing of built form does not have an 
unacceptable impact upon the view towards or from the waterfront. 
3.7.4.2.2 
Buildings in the Shoreline designation shall be sited to limit the removal of 
vegetation and to preserve significant landscape features. 
3.7.4.2.3 
The height of buildings in proximity to the shoreline will be limited to maintain 
the character of shoreline areas and existing development. 
3.7.4.3 
Undeveloped Land in the Shoreline Residential Designation 
3.7.4.3.1 
Not all the land designated on Schedule ‘A’ as Shoreline Residential has 
been subject to intensive site evaluations. Consequently, the designation of 
land as Shoreline Residential is no assurance that any given land is suitable 
for development. New developments proposed within the designation shall 
be reviewed using a cautionary approach, with the attention being given in 
particular to the impacts of new developments on the natural environment. 
New development proposals shall be assessed on their individual merits and 
should site conditions be unable to support sound, planned development, 
new proposals may be refused. 
3.7.4.4 
Redevelopment in the Shoreline Residential Designation 
3.7.4.4.1 
It is recognized that a significant amount of development that will occur in the 
Shoreline Residential designation over the life of this Plan will occur through 
redevelopment of existing properties. The Zoning By-law shall contain 
specific performance standards to ensure that the character of the traditional 
Mod # 47

development in the Shoreline Residential designation is maintained by 
including performance standards to ensure that the density and massing of 
new development will maintain the traditional character of the area. 
3.7.4.4.2 
When considering applications for redevelopment in the Shoreline Residential 
designation, Council and the approval authority shall ensure the proposed 
development maintains the built and natural character of the area, including 
height, massing and density. Consideration shall be given to maintaining 
existing vegetation and the planting of native species.

3.9 
COMMERCIAL DESIGNATIONS 
 
3.9.1 
Introduction 
 
3.9.1.1 
The Plan contains four commercial land use designations which include Core 
Commercial, 
Office 
Residential, 
Highway 
Commercial, 
and 
Marine 
Commercial. The economy of the Town is focused to a large extent upon 
providing services to year round and seasonal residents as well as tourists, 
and the agricultural sector. The two urban centres form the focal points for 
the service economy. 
3.9.1.2 
The Town recognizes that to a great degree the social and economic well 
being of the community is dependent upon a diverse and balanced 
commercial base, focused on the core commercial areas. There are limits to 
further business expansion within the core areas, and it is the Town’s 
intention to provide opportunities for commercial activities outside of the core 
areas in appropriate locations. 
3.10 
CORE COMMERCIAL DESIGNATION 
 
3.10.1 
Purpose 
 
3.10.1.1 
The Core Commercial designation represents the historic commercial 
downtown core within the Port Elgin and Southampton communities. The 
designation applies to those parts of Port Elgin and Southampton where it is 
recognized that commercial activity has customarily and historically taken 
place and where infrastructure has been developed to serve this purpose. It 
is the intent of the Plan to foster the general business function and encourage 
the expansion of retail, office and public uses in the Core Commercial Areas. 
3.10.1.2 
The Core Commercial designation will continue to provide the commercial, 
business and institutional focal points for the Town. All development and 
redevelopment will be directed toward retaining and improving the economic 
viability of land uses within the Core Commercial designation. 
3.10.2 
Objectives 
 
3.10.2.1 
To maintain and enhance the core areas as the economic focus of the 
community. 
3.10.2.2 
To enhance the character, identity, vitality, uniqueness and awareness of the 
two core areas of Port Elgin and Southampton. 
 
3.10.2.3 
To maintain the role of the core areas as community gathering places and as 
the commercial and social focal points for the Settlement Area and the 
surrounding farm community. 
3.10.2.4 
To encourage the integration of residential uses in the Core Commercial 
Designation through intensification by the development of residential units 
above or behind compatible commercial uses, and through increased 
residential development within and in the vicinity of the cores.

Official Plan 
56 
Adopted by Council Dec. 10, 2012 
Approved by Bruce County: March 26, 2014 
 
3.10.2.5 
To visually enhance the entrances of the core areas. 
3.10.2.6 
To ensure that new development is in character with existing development in 
the Core Commercial designation. 
3.10.3 
Permitted Uses 
 
3.10.3.1 
Permitted uses shall be limited to those commercial establishments offering 
goods and services that primarily serve the entire Town and surrounding 
market area. Permitted uses include but are not limited to retail commercial 
establishments, offices, personal service establishments, banks, places of 
entertainment, assembly halls, hotels, motels, child care centres, community 
facilities, public uses, recreational uses, restaurants, convenience stores, 
residential units above the first floor or behind the commercial use on the 
main floor, and high density residential development in accordance with the 
medium density and high density residential development policies of this 
Plan.  Home-based child care and unlicensed child care in legally existing 
single detached and semi-detached dwellings are permitted. 
3.10.4 
General Policies 
 
3.10.4.1 
Development Form 
3.10.4.1.1 It is the intent of this Plan that the Core Commercial designation remains 
compact in order to create a pedestrian environment and to achieve strong 
commercial nodes. New development shall be encouraged in the existing 
Core Commercial designation provided the scale, density and character is in- 
keeping with development in the area. The expansion of the commercial uses 
to adjacent residential areas shall be discouraged. 
3.10.4.1.2 It is the intent of this Plan that the progressive features and positive 
characteristics, which have developed in the Core Commercial designation 
be retained and reinforced. Development of vacant sites and redevelopment 
of existing areas in the Core Commercial designation shall be encouraged in 
a comprehensive manner with a view to coordinating individual site designs 
and providing integrated solutions to pedestrian and vehicular traffic 
circulation problems. This includes the conversion of existing Residential Unit 
or Buildings to commercial uses, provided that the residential character of the 
Residential Unit or Building and property is maintained. To further these 
objectives, Council may require that prospective developers of lands in the 
Core Commercial designation enter into a Development Agreement with the 
Town. 
3.10.4.1.3 Although intensification of use will be inherent in most development or 
redevelopment, it is the intent of this Plan that in any rehabilitation, 
conservation, development or redevelopment schemes for the Core 
Commercial designation place emphasis on the provision of abundant light 
and air space, the provision of attractive and usable open space available to 
the public, the aesthetic value of enclosed areas as well as open areas, the 
importance of public buildings as focal points of civic improvements, the 
restoration of existing buildings wherever possible, and the retention of 
historical atmosphere and buildings. High standards of civic design 
Town of Saugeen Shores 
Official Plan 
57 
Adopted by Council Dec. 10, 2012 
Approved by Bruce County: March 26, 2014 
 
emphasizing unity, coherence, and aesthetic appeal shall be the goal 
throughout. 
3.10.4.1.4 Adequate setbacks and/or buffer planting shall be provided between the 
commercial uses and any adjacent residential and institutional areas. Such 
buffer planting may include the provision of grass strips, berms, screening, 
and appropriate planting of trees and shrubs. 
3.10.4.1.5 No parking requirements will be required within the Core Commercial 
designation except for land uses requiring overnight accommodation such as 
hotels or residential uses. 
3.10.4.1.6 Land uses such as outdoor patios will be assessed as to their impact on 
nearby residential development and whether appropriate noise attenuation 
can achieve compatibility. 
3.10.4.1.7 The Town may undertake a height study to consider appropriate minimum 
and maximum heights for new development in the Core Commercial 
designation. The resultant height policies could be incorporated in the Plan. 
3.10.4.2 
Downtown Improvement 
3.10.4.2.1 The Town will work with downtown merchants, and property owners to 
improve the core areas and waterfront areas as tourist destinations. 
3.10.4.2.2 The establishment of Community Improvement Areas, the study of these 
areas and the implementation of improvement initiatives shall be considered 
by Council. 
3.10.4.2.3 Improvements to the streetscape, individual buildings, parking areas and 
pedestrian environment are desirable and will be encouraged in accordance 
with municipal design guidelines. 
3.10.4.2.4 The historical character of the Core Commercial designation will be enhanced 
by: 
a) ensuring that public improvements are sensitive to the heritage character 
of the area; 
 
b) ensuring that essential heritage features are conserved, incorporated or 
maintained when new uses or development are proposed to a heritage 
feature; 
 
c) supporting bonus zoning provisions or transfer of density provisions 
authorized under the Planning Act as an incentive to the private sector for 
heritage conservation; 
 
d) ensuring that the Zoning By-Law imposes both minimum and maximum 
heights and setbacks in order to maintain compatible and complementing 
streetscape characteristics within the core and, in particular, adjacent to 
established buildings of traditional two and three-storey construction at 
the building line; and, 
 
e) ensuring that the Town considers the following when reviewing Planning 
Town of Saugeen Shores 
Official Plan 
58 
Adopted by Council Dec. 10, 2012 
Approved by Bruce County: March 26, 2014 
 
Act applications that propose to increase the height of a building: that the 
proposed building would be compatible and complementary to the 
streetscape within the core; that the proposed height increase is in- 
keeping with the character of the surrounding area; that the proposed 
height can be adequately serviced by emergency service equipment; that 
shadows from the building will not impact neighboring property owners or 
the streetscape.

OFFICE RESIDENTIAL DESIGNATION 
 
3.11.1 
Purpose 
 
3.11.1.1 
The intent of the Office Residential designation is to preserve and add 
flexibility to the use of older buildings designed and historically used for low 
density residential uses that, due to their size or location in proximity to the 
existing commercial areas and/or frontage on an arterial road, provide a 
unique opportunity for certain types of small-scale commercial use. This Plan 
recognizes the important role of these established residential areas in 
creating an attractive edge and gateway to core areas, and seeks to preserve 
the residential character of the areas while providing for compatible forms of 
commercial and office uses within the existing buildings in order to support 
continued use and investment. Any portion of this land use category which 
abuts a residential land use designation in this Plan shall be developed in a 
manner that is compatible with the adjacent residential areas. 
3.11.2 
Objectives 
 
3.11.2.1 
To provide for a transition area between the Core Commercial designation 
and surrounding areas. 
3.11.2.2 
To recognize existing commercial, office and small scale institutional uses on 
the fringe of the Core Commercial designation and to permit the use of 
existing Residential Unit or Buildings fronting on Highway 21 for these uses 
when compatible with the physical character of the area and surrounding land 
uses. 
3.11.2.3 
To permit some commercial flexibility in areas comprised of older residential 
structures adjacent to the Core Commercial designation while maintaining the 
residential appearance and character of the area. 
3.11.3 
Permitted Uses 
 
3.11.3.1 
The permitted uses in the Office Residential designation shall include 
residential units, bed and breakfast establishment, office, studio and personal 
service establishments and limited retail uses. Small scale institutional uses 
such as child care centres, home-based child care, unlicensed child care, 
places of worship, funeral homes, clinics and clubs are permitted and may be 
located in separate buildings that maintain the character of the area.

Zoning By-law Amendment Requirements 
3.11.4.2.1 In considering Zoning By-law Amendments that propose to modify 
performance standard or add to the permitted uses within a zone, Council 
shall ensure that that the following criteria are satisfied: 
a) the proposed use maintains the intent of the Office Residential policies; 
 
b) the proposed use would not be considered more appropriate in another 
land use designation; 
 
c) the proposed use is suitable for the subject property with regard to the 
shape of the lands and the intensity of the use proposed. Consideration 
shall be given to the scale and layout of the buildings, landscaping, 
parking, etc.; 
 
d) the proposed use is compatible with adjacent land uses, with 
consideration given to the height, location and spacing of any buildings 
involved in the property development, noise and odour emitted from the 
proposed use, potential loss of privacy for neighbours, and effect on 
heritage resources; 
 
e) the existing traffic patterns are not significantly impacted and potential 
conflicts with pedestrians are avoided; 
 
f) measures are taken to mitigate potential adverse impacts on surrounding

HIGHWAY COMMERCIAL DESIGNATION 
 
3.12.1 
Purpose 
 
3.12.1.1 
The purpose of the Highway Commercial designation is to provide sufficient 
lands in suitable locations for commercial land uses that are not suited to 
locate within the existing structures in the core but are supportive of the 
general commercial needs of the residents of Saugeen Shores, visitors, and 
neighbouring communities. Retail establishments should be encouraged to 
locate in the Core Commercial designation of Port Elgin and Southampton. 
However, it is recognized that retail floor space for medium or large size 
businesses within the core areas is rare. The Highway Commercial 
designation is intended for development of larger format commercial uses 
which due to their size and function may be unable to locate in the Core 
Commercial designation. 
3.12.2 
Objectives 
 
3.12.2.1 
To encourage Highway Commercial developments that do not adversely 
affect the commercial activities contained in the Core Commercial 
designation.

3.18.4.2.2 In the absence of a study providing more detailed information, the flooding 
and/or erosion allowance shall be 15 metres inland from the 100 year flood 
level. The dynamic beach allowance shall be 30 metres inland from the flood 
and/or erosion limit. For the Lake Huron Shoreline located north of South 
Street in Southampton, to the northerly limit of the Municipality, the shoreline 
hazard includes the 15 metre flooding and erosion hazard and appropriate 
setback for the dynamic beach allowance. The dynamic beach allowance 
often contains sensitive landforms such as dunes and important flora. Any 
site alteration in the environmentally sensitive portions of the dynamic beach 
allowance such as filling, grading or vegetation removal will not be permitted 
unless supported by the results of an Environmental Impact Statement and/or 
approval from the Saugeen Valley Conservation Authority. 
3.18.4.3 
Conservation Authority Regulations 
3.18.4.3.1 Development, including site alteration that is proposed within the regulated 
area of the Saugeen Valley Conservation Authority shall be reviewed and 
considered by the Saugeen Valley Conservation Authority. 
3.18.4.4 
Watercourse Flooding and Erosion 
3.18.4.4.1 For all watercourses within the Town of Saugeen Shores, flood plains shall 
be managed according to the “one-zone policy”. Under the one-zone policy 
Town of Saugeen Shores 
Official Plan

no new buildings or structures are permitted anywhere in the floodplain, 
except in accordance with the Section 3.18.4.1.1, Section 3.18.4.5 – Spill 
Policy Area and Section 3.18.4.6 – Development in Shallow Flood Areas. 
 
3.18.4.5 
Spill Area Policy 
3.18.4.5.1 Developments on lands not considered “Hazard Lands”, but identified on 
zoning schedules as being within 50 metres of a Spill Weir, are considered to 
be within the Spill Area Policy of the Saugeen Valley Conservation Authority 
and shall be subject to the policies of the Authority in this regard. 
3.18.4.5.2 The Saugeen Valley Conservation Authority Spill Area Policy applies to all 
lands within 50 metres measured horizontally, of a Spill Weir. New 
developments may be permitted within a Spill Area provided that they meet 
all applicable policies of this Plan, and are flood-proofed to the elevation of 
the Hurricane Hazel Flood Event Standard Flood Plain. 
3.18.4.5.3 Flood-proofing of additions to all existing uses within the Spill Area may be 
permitted to an elevation less than that of the Hurricane Hazel Flood Event 
Standard Flood Plain provided that the flood-proofing of the addition is not to 
an elevation less than that of the floor elevation of the existing use. 
3.18.4.5.4 Written permission of the Saugeen Valley Conservation Authority is required 
prior to any construction within the regulated area. In each case an 
application, describing the proposed construction, must be made to the 
Authority for its review and consideration. 
3.18.4.6 
Development in Shallow Flood Areas 
3.18.4.6.1 Where new development is proposed in generally the northeast part of the 
Town despite the policies throughout this Plan which permit development to 
occur, property owners are advised that there is the potential for flooding in 
areas not designated “Environmental Hazard” and not within the Spill Area 
Policy. While the flooding may be infrequent and shallow, the extent of the 
flooding cannot be shown on the mapping. It is advised that all new 
development should consider the possibility of flooding and property owners 
should design buildings accordingly. Design considerations might include: 
elevating the ground floor level well above surrounding ground levels; 
elevating building openings; and, elevating or deleting basements. 
3.18.4.7 
Redesignation of Environmental Hazard Lands 
3.18.4.7.1 When more detailed hazard mapping becomes available and is accepted by 
the Town, or should flood control or other works be undertaken that are 
acceptable to the Town and the Saugeen Valley Conservation Authority 
which result in changes in areas designated Environmental Hazard, then this 
Plan will be amended as required. Applicants are advised to consult with the 
Saugeen Valley Conservation Authority prior to submitting an application to 
remove lands from the Environmental Hazard designation. 
3.18.4.7.2 The following criteria will be taken into account:

3.19.4.3 
Public Waterfront Policies 
3.19.4.3.1 The Lake Huron shoreline area in Saugeen Shores provides for a wide range 
of community, recreational, tourism, parks and open space and cultural uses. 
The waterfront is a significant recreational, economic and natural resource in 
the Town that requires continued maintenance, protection and enhancement. 
Most of the shoreline area is designated as Environmental Hazard lands due 
to the flood risks and the sensitive dynamic beach areas that limit 
development potential. However, this Plan supports the continued and 
enhanced use of the waterfront for a diverse range of community, 
recreational, tourism, parks and open space uses, subject to the policies of 
the “Environmental Hazard” designation. In addition, the following policies 
shall apply to public use of the waterfront and the provision of parks, open 
space, trails and recreational opportunities along the waterfront within the 
Settlement Area. 
3.19.4.3.2 The Town will continue to provide and enhance a visible, inter-connected and 
publicly accessible waterfront for a wide range of public and tourism activities 
while maintaining natural waterfront features and recognizing the limitations 
created by the flood hazard. 
3.19.4.3.3 Development of publicly owned waterfront open space will be in accordance 
with a Council approved Parks and Trails Master Plan and/or Waterfront 
Strategy. 
3.19.4.3.4 Public waterfront areas shall be designed to be safe, attractive, inviting and 
visually separated from private land uses. 
3.19.4.3.5 Use of and access to publicly owned waterfront areas for community, 
recreational and tourism activities will be maximized within a framework of 
ensuring long-term sustainability of the natural shoreline environment. 
3.19.4.3.6 Private property encroachments on public waterfront access points, municipal 
parkland, trails, and natural environment areas will not be permitted. Where 
existing encroachments exist, the Town may enter into lease agreements to 
recognize the use of these lands. The Town may also develop a by-law to 
recognize existing encroachments and to regulate how encroachments are to 
be considered. 
3.19.4.3.7 A continuous waterfront trail will be implemented in accordance with the 
Parks and Trails Master Plan where there is sufficient land between the water 
and a public or private road and where the natural characteristics of the 
shoreline environment permit. The Waterfront Trail will be connected to 
existing waterfront public open spaces and other points of interest along the 
waterfront. 
3.19.4.3.8 Bonus provisions under the Planning Act may be considered for waterfront 
development to encourage the dedication of lands for use as a waterfront 
public open space system. 
3.19.4.3.9 Public access to the shoreline, in areas of public ownership, shall be

SPECIAL POLICY AREA DESIGNATIONS 
 
3.20.1 
Special Policy Area #1 
 
3.20.1.1 
The area designated as SPA (1) on Schedule “A” Land Use Plan includes 
lands in Port Elgin generally located north of Elgin Street, east of Hilker 
Street, and west of the Rail Trail and a small area of land east of Wellington 
Street immediately north and south of River Street. Due to the proximity to 
the former railway, this area has historically been designated and used for 
industrial purposes. However, with the abandonment of the railway and 
location of these lands along the Rail Trail in an area surrounded by 
established residential neighbourhoods, it is an objective of this Plan to 
encourage re-development of these lands to residential use over the planning 
period. 
3.20.1.2 
Existing industrial uses within SPA (1) are recognized as permitted uses and 
shall be permitted to continue with limited expansion on their existing sites in 
accordance with the requirements of the implementing Zoning By-law. Any 
proposed change of use of these lands to another form of industrial use shall 
be subject to the policies of the “Employment” designation, Section 3.15 of 
this Plan. 
3.20.1.3 
The redevelopment of lands within SPA (1) to medium or high density 
residential use is permitted and supported in accordance with the policies for 
the “Residential” designation, Section 3.6 of this Plan. Setbacks may be 
required to existing Industrial uses in accordance with Ministry of the 
Environment Guidelines. Prior to development, the Town may require site 
investigation by a qualified professional to assess potential contamination 
and decommissioning requirements necessary to permit use of the lands for 
residential development. 
3.20.2 
Special Policy Area #2 
 
3.20.2.1 
The residential portion of Southampton located between Lake Huron, the 
Saugeen River, Grosvenor Street, Island Street, Huron Street and Bay Street, 
designated as SPA (2) on Schedule “A” Land Use Plan, is best characterized 
as a well-established low density, low rise residential neighbourhood. Most 
Residential Unit or Buildings within this area are one or two storey homes. 
The implementing Zoning By-law and the assessment of development 
applications may result in the application of reduced height requirements in 
order to ensure compatibility with the built form of the existing community. 
3.20.3 
Special Policy Area #3 
 
3.20.3.1 
It is recognized that the lands designated SPA (3) on Schedule “A” to this 
Plan exhibit environmental hazard features due to flooding and/or poor 
drainage. Development may be permitted in accordance with the Residential 
policies of this Plan, provided a Stormwater Management Study is completed 
demonstrating that concerns regarding flood and fill and floodplain 
management can be dealt with through lot grading and stormwater facilities to

the satisfaction of the Town and the Saugeen Valley Conservation Authority. 
Furthermore, although the woodlands on the subject property are not 
considered “significant woodlands”, the proponent shall prepare a tree 
retention plan to ensure that tree removal be kept to a minimum for the 
development of the property to the satisfaction of the Town and the Saugeen 
Valley Conservation Authority. Prior to granting removal of the holding 
symbol in the Comprehensive Zoning By-law to permit residential 
development of any portion of the lands within “Special Policy Area #3”, the 
Town shall consult with the Saugeen Valley Conservation Authority to ensure 
that the stormwater management policies have been appropriately 
addressed. 
3.20.4 
Special Policy Area #4 
 
3.20.4.1 
The area designated as SPA (4) on Schedule “A” Land Use Plan, generally 
encompasses the lands west of the glacial Lake Nipissing bluff, south of 
South Street, in the former Town of Southampton, and north of Lot 19, Lake 
Range, in the former Township of Saugeen, but excludes the former Town of 
Port Elgin and those developed areas existing prior to the date of the 
adoption of this Plan. It is recognized that much of this special Policy Area 
exhibits important natural heritage features, such as significant woodlands, 
significant wildlife habitat, fish habitat, and species of conservation concern. 
The area also represents a substantial portion of the forested and wetland 
habitats within the planning area, as well as provides local connectivity of the 
natural features. Further, a large amount of the area consists of hazardous 
lands and sites. High groundwater conditions and complex drainage are 
common. 
3.20.4.2 
It is also recognized that new residential uses are permitted in specific and 
limited locations designated as Shoreline Residential that avoid hazardous 
features. With proper site design, the impacts of the developments on the 
environment can be minimized, to the extent that is possible, and surface and 
sub-surface drainage can be addressed. Preliminary Environmental Review 
Studies have been completed for most of these specific areas. 
3.20.4.3 
All lands within SPA (4) not shown as Residential or Shoreline Residential 
are designated Environmental Hazard and shall be subject to the policies of 
Section 3.18 of this Plan. For this Special Policy Area, the Environmental 
Hazard designation includes not just natural hazard elements but also natural 
heritage features. As such, site alterations and vegetation removal shall not 
be permitted except in accordance with proper forest management practices 
and passive recreation uses, such as hiking trails. 
3.20.4.4 
Minor adjustments to the Environmental Hazard boundary may not require an 
amendment to this Plan, following consultation with the Saugeen Valley 
Conservation Authority. 
3.20.4.5 
New development may be permitted in the areas designated Shoreline 
Residential within SPA (4) in accordance with Section 3.7 Shoreline 
Residential of this Plan and the following additional policies:

a) A site-specific Environmental Impact Statement shall be completed for 
each development proposal in accordance with Section 6.27.4 of this 
Plan and the following criteria: 
 
i) 
The Environmental Impact Statement shall focus on the features 
found within the Shoreline Residential designation and immediately 
adjacent to it. A detailed study to assess the site in the context of the 
whole of SPA (4) is not required. 
 
ii) Flora and fauna species that are endangered, threatened or of 
conservation concern shall be identified and protected, with particular 
attention to the provincially rare Dwarf Lake Iris. 
 
iii) A tree retention plan shall be completed, with the objectives of 
minimizing tree removal and disturbance, and protecting vegetation 
communities of conservation concern. To help off-set the loss of trees 
due to development, the tree retention plan shall identify areas where 
new trees will be provided, either on the lands subject to development 
or on other lands within or near SPA (4). The ratio of new trees 
planted to trees removed shall be at least 2:1. Only those new trees 
for the purposes of restoring and/or establishing natural features 
habitat, and not for landscaping purposes, shall be considered. 
 
iv) In addition to the Stormwater Management Policies of this Plan, it may 
be required that more detailed drainage and/or hydrogeologic 
information be produced by the proponent, to ensure potential on-site 
and off-site effects are fully addressed. 
 
v) During the review of development proposals for particular property in 
the Shoreline Residential designation, land owners will be encouraged 
to transfer ownership or control of the portion of the property 
designated ‘Environmental Hazard’ to a public body or qualified 
organization to ensure long-term preservation and management of the 
natural features.

4.3 
ROADWAY NETWORK 
 
4.3.1 
Roadway Classification System 
 
4.3.1.1 
Roads are classified according to the function they serve. This Official Plan 
classifies roads as follows: 
• 
Arterial Roads 
• 
Collector Roads 
• 
Local Roads 
4.3.1.2 
Schedule B to this Plan identifies the classification of roadways within the 
Settlement Area. Road classifications that are identified outside of the limits 
of the Settlement Area do not form part of this Plan but have been included 
for future information purposes and may be included as part of the Bruce 
County Official Plan. 
4.3.2 
Arterial Roads 
 
4.3.2.1 
Arterial Roads provide for high passenger and commercial traffic volumes. 
Direct property access to new facilities is discouraged and will be controlled

Town of Saugeen Shores 
Official Plan 
89 
Adopted by Council Dec. 10, 2012 
Approved by Bruce County: March 26, 2014 
 
to limit the spacing of driveways and new public road intersections. Arterial 
roads are main traffic routes intended for large volumes of long and medium 
range traffic moving to destinations within or through the Town. 
4.3.2.2 
Arterial roads shall have a minimum right-of-way width of 26 to 30 metres. 
4.3.2.3 
It is the intent of this Plan to limit access to Arterial roads. All proposals for 
new development along arterial roads must consider the impact of the 
proposed use on the functioning of the arterial road and shared access points 
may be required. 
4.3.2.4 
Where development or redevelopment is proposed that has frontage on both 
an Arterial Road and a Collector or Local Road, access shall be from the 
Collector or Local Road. 
4.3.2.5 
The County of Bruce is the approval authority for entrance/access on to a 
County Arterial Road and may grant or refuse access. 
4.3.3 
Collector Roads 
 
4.3.3.1 
Collector Roads provide service for moderate traffic volumes between local 
roads and the arterial roads, while at the same time providing access to 
individual properties. 
4.3.3.2 
Collector Roads shall have a minimum right-of-way width of 22.0 to 26.2 
metres. 
4.3.3.3 
Direct access to abutting properties is generally permitted along Collector 
Roads. At the intersection of Collector and Local Roads, direct driveway 
access shall be provided from the Local Road. 
4.3.3.4 
Bruce Street is identified on Schedule B to the Official Plan as a Collector 
Road. Improvements to Bruce Street should consider a right-of-way width of 
26.2 metres. 
4.3.4 
Local Roads 
 
4.3.4.1 
Local roads generally carry light volumes of traffic at low speed and provide 
direct access to abutting land uses. Local roads shall be designed to 
discourage through-traffic. The minimum right-of-way width for local roads 
shall be 20 metres. 
4.3.5 
Lanes 
 
4.3.5.1 
The establishment of new private lanes will not be permitted, unless 
approved through a plan of condominium. 
4.3.5.2 
The Town of Saugeen Shores contains a number of public lanes that could 
provide the opportunities for residential intensification within the Built up Area.

Official Plan 
90 
Adopted by Council Dec. 10, 2012 
Approved by Bruce County: March 26, 2014 
 
4.3.5.3 
The existing lanes are generally a substandard width to provide appropriate 
access, servicing and emergency services. The Town may consider a lesser 
right-of-way width for lanes on the basis of their function as providing access 
to a limited number of properties. 
4.3.5.4 
The Town may develop a design and engineering manual for the 
development of existing lanes. 
4.3.5.5 
Where new or redevelopment is proposed on a lane, servicing infrastructure 
such as roads, water and sewage servicing and utilities shall be developed to 
the satisfaction of the Town. 
4.3.5.6 
The Town may require the entering of a development agreement between 
property owners and the Town in order to ensure the site is appropriately 
designed and serviced. 
4.3.5.7 
Through the implementing Zoning By-law, the Town may create a specific 
zone to establish permitted uses and performance standards for development 
that may occur on lanes. 
4.3.5.8 
The Town is not required to assume maintenance of lanes however, the 
Town may consider assuming maintenance of a lane, subject to the following 
criteria: 
a) the lane is developed to a municipal standard; 
b) the lane can provide safe access for emergency vehicles; and, 
c) agreements as required have been entered into between property owners 
and the Town

GENERAL TRANSPORTATION POLICIES 
 
4.4.1 
Rights-of-Way 
 
4.4.1.1 
Council shall reserve or obtain the necessary rights-of-way for proposed 
roads and/or roadway widening as a condition of development approval. 
Existing and planned municipal rights-of-way shall be protected for future 
roadways and/or roadway widening in accordance with the intended right-of- 
way widths established in this Plan for each roadway classification shown on 
Schedule B. Setbacks from specific road segments required to achieve the 
ultimate right-of-way widths for each roadway will be established in the 
Comprehensive Zoning By-law. 
4.4.2 
Right-of-Way Width 
 
4.4.2.1 
At the discretion of Council, deviations from the minimum right-of-way width 
established in Section 4.3.2 to 4.3.4 may be considered on the merits of an 
improved streetscape, better utility of the land base, impacts to the social and 
physical environments, function of the road and life-cycle costs. 
4.4.2.2 
Where extensive development has occurred along existing roads, it is 
Mod # 24 
Town of Saugeen Shores 
Official Plan 
91 
Adopted by Council Dec. 10, 2012

recognized that the desired right-of-way width may not be achievable. 
4.4.3 
Road Allowances and Public Lands 
 
4.4.3.1 
The Town will not stop up or sell unmaintained road allowances or other 
municipal owned land that provide access to properties where there is any 
possibility that there is a potential future public use for the lands unless 
alternative access options are available for impacted properties. Road 
allowances or public lands leading to water or leading to an original Shore 
Road Allowance shall not be sold to abutting property owners unless there 
are other more usable public access points leading to the water in the 
immediate area. 
4.4.3.2 
Nothing in this section shall obligate the Town to open or improve existing 
unopened road allowances. 
4.4.3.3 
Where historic building or structure encroachments exist, the Town may only 
consider the sale of a Road Allowance or Public Lands in accordance with 
the policies of Section 4.4.3.1 and where the relocation of the building or 
structure is not practical or feasible. 
4.4.4 
Commercial Truck Traffic 
 
4.4.4.1 
In order to improve traffic flows related to truck traffic the Town may: 
a) obtain Provincial and County commitment to improve Provincial and 
County road connections in and around Saugeen Shores to provide an 
adequate alternative route for truck traffic moving goods across the 
Province; 
 
b) consult with major trucking agencies and industries to establish truck 
routes for their operations that will avoid residential areas and community 
activity centres; 
 
c) restrict land use activities, which generate substantial truck traffic, to 
industrial or commercial areas and ensure that these areas are 
adequately served by arterial/commercial roadways away from residential 
areas and community activity areas; and, 
 
d) develop a formal truck route By-law to identify particular road sections 
where trucks are prohibited or restricted by time/day. 
 
4.4.5 
Trails And Active Transportation 
 
4.4.5.1 
The Town will encourage new developments and redevelopments to consider 
the needs of the pedestrian and cycling public whenever possible and will 
promote the upgrading and expansion of the existing trail and walkway 
network in accordance with the Parks and Trails Master Plan. 
Town of Saugeen Shores 
Official Plan 
92 
Adopted by Council Dec. 10, 2012 
Approved by Bruce County: March 26, 2014 
 
4.4.5.2 
Schedules A and B identify the location of existing and proposed trails. 
Development proposals adjacent to existing trails will be encouraged to 
provide open space links to the trail to encourage its use for non-motorized 
modes of transportation such as walking and cycling. 
4.4.5.3 
When road improvements are undertaken and new roads are constructed, 
consideration will be given to promoting active transportation through the 
development of active transportation routes including, bike lanes and on-road 
trail routes. 
4.4.5.4 
The Town will aim to ensure sidewalks are provided on at least one side of 
local roads and on both sides of arterial and collector roads wherever 
feasible. 
4.4.5.5 
Where new development is proposed adjacent to active transportation routes 
and trails, the Town may require buffering and screening of adjacent land 
uses to ensure protection of the recreational use and enjoyment of the trails 
by the entire community. Buffering and screening may not be appropriate 
where a trail is developed in association with a Road. 
4.4.5.6 
Where lands to be developed include proposed trails or active transportation 
routes shown on Schedule B, the Town shall acquire the lands for the trails. 
Land for trails shall be conveyed to the trails in a condition suitable for trail 
use. 
4.4.5.7 
The development of a system of multi-use recreational trails linking 
residential areas, employment areas, community facilities, parks and open 
space and the waterfront will be guided by a Council approved Parks and 
Trails Master Plan and the policies of this Plan. 
4.4.6 
Specialized Transit Initiatives 
 
4.4.6.1 
The Town recognizes, as a result of its aging population and higher than 
average percentage of residents in the senior population cohorts, that 
services which cater to the needs of the mobility challenged public will 
become increasingly important over the life of the Plan. 
4.4.6.2 
The Town will encourage the consideration and development of specialized 
transit initiatives. 
4.4.7 
Airport 
 
4.4.7.1 
The Municipal Airport plays an important role in promoting and supporting 
tourism in Saugeen Shores. An objective of this Plan is to recognize and 
support continued tourism and recreational use of the Municipal Airport and 
to ensure its protection from potentially incompatible land use and 
development which could compromise flight safety and future viability of 
airport operations.

SECTION 5 – SERVICING AND UTILITIES 
 
5.1 
INTRODUCTION 
 
5.1.1 
This Section provides the basis for the development of servicing and utility 
infrastructure in the Town of Saugeen Shores. 
5.2 
OBJECTIVES 
 
5.2.1 
In order to minimize the cost of services provided by all public agencies, no 
new development in the Town will be permitted in any location where it would 
contribute to a demand for public services that are not economically feasible 
to provide, improve, or maintain. Instead, development will be permitted only 
in locations where demands on public services will be minimized, or where it 
can most effectively utilize existing services, or where new services can be 
economically provided and maintained either by the Town or by the 
developer. As per Section 34(5) of the Planning Act, R.S.O. 1990 Chap.P.13, 
the ability to properly service the land will determine whether development 
shall occur, notwithstanding the existence of an appropriate Official Plan 
designation and/or zoning which would otherwise permit the development. 
5.3 
SEWAGE AND WATER SERVICING 
 
5.3.1 
General Policies 
 
5.3.1.1 
Urban development or redevelopment in the Town of Saugeen Shores shall 
be directed to the Settlement Area and developed on the basis of municipal 
water services and sewage services. 
5.3.1.2 
The extension of services will be a determining factor in the phasing of new 
development. Where the servicing of new urban development requires 
extensions and/or improvements to the existing public piped systems, such 
servicing will generally be financed, constructed, and maintained by the 
developer before being turned over to the Town. 
5.3.1.3 
Within the Settlement Area, Council approval will be required before any 
development is permitted on private individual on-site sewage disposal and/or 
individual on-site water systems. Approval may be conditional on an 
appropriate water supply and the suitability of the site to support an individual 
on-site sewage service. In these instances, the property owner shall enter 
into an agreement to be held on title that requires connection to municipal 
services should they become available. New lot creation or redevelopment 
of existing lots shall also be undertaken in a manner that would facilitate the 
connection to municipal services and additional lot creation should services 
become available. 
5.3.1.4 
When development of any type will utilize a private individual on-site sewage 
disposal and/or water system(s), then the lot area shall comply with the 
guidelines of the Ministry of Environment and the requirements of the Town of 
Saugeen Shores or its designated agent for the type of development 
proposed and the type of private individual on-site system to be used. 
Mod # 33

Official Plan 
95 
Adopted by Council Dec. 10, 2012 
Approved by Bruce County: March 26, 2014 
 
5.3.1.5 
Areas currently on private systems will be required to connect to a public 
system should the services become available. 
5.3.1.6 
A Settlement Capability Study shall be required where private individual on- 
site sewage disposal systems and/or private individual on-site water systems 
are proposed for multi-lot or multi-unit development of more than five (5) 
lots/units or potential for more than five (5) lots/units. 
5.3.1.7 
New development proposals shall not be granted approvals unless adequate 
uncommitted reserve water and sewage treatment capacity is demonstrated 
to be available to be allocated to accommodate the development of the site. 
Any development on public piped, private communal, private individual on- 
site or partial services must be within the reserve sewage system and reserve 
water system capacity. The determination of sufficient reserve sewage 
system capacity shall include treatment capacity for hauled sewage from 
private communal and individual on-site sewage systems. The availability of 
uncommitted reserve servicing capacity shall be based on the Ministry of 
Environment policies and guidelines. 
5.3.1.8 
When the capacity of the water and sewage facilities have been fully 
allocated and prior to the facilities reaching their hydraulic capacity, the Town 
shall demonstrate a commitment to the expansion of the facilities in 
accordance with the municipal servicing strategy/plan, before additional 
approvals are given to further development proposals. Limitations in the 
capacity and operating performance of the water and sewage facilities will be 
recognized as a constraint to the approval and timing of new development 
proposals. 
5.3.1.9 
It shall be the policy of the Town to not grant sewage allocation until the time 
of subdivision registration. Draft plans of subdivision sewage allocation shall 
be limited to three years in order to ensure reserve capacity is efficiently and 
effectively utilized. Council will not approve new development or issue 
building permits for development, which would result in flows to the facility 
exceeding its hydraulic design capacity. 
5.3.1.10 
Council shall consider expansions to the sewage treatments plants, water 
treatment plant and servicing infrastructure in accordance with the Water and 
Sewer Master Plan and within the financial means of the Town. 
5.3.1.11 
All services, whether municipal, private communal or individual on-site, shall 
comply with the requirements of the Ministry of the Environment, the 
Environmental Protection Act, Ontario Water Resources Act, and other 
Provincial and municipal requirements, as applicable. 
5.3.1.12 
Schedule "A" identifies the location of all sewage treatment works in the 
Town. 
5.3.1.13 
No sensitive land uses will be permitted within 150 metres of the sewage 
treatment cells of the Town's sewage treatment works. In this regard, the 
Official Plan identifies a 150 metre buffer Methane Buffer Limit around the 
sewage treatment works.

STORMWATER MANAGEMENT 
 
5.4.1 
General Policies 
 
5.4.1.1 
Stormwater management is required to ensure that runoff is controlled so that 
it does not increase peak flows to any greater extent than pre-development 
runoff in watercourses that impact on downstream flooding, to control erosion 
and sedimentation, and to protect and enhance water quality and aquatic 
habitat. 
5.4.1.2 
As required by the Town, or other agency, new development proposals may 
be required to be supported by a stormwater management study prepared by 
a qualified professional to determine the effect of increased run-off due to 
development of the site, and to identify stormwater management measures 
as necessary to control any increases in flows in downstream watercourses, 
up to and including the 1:100 year design storm. 
5.4.1.3 
Consideration shall also be given to the recommendations of any watershed 
and subwatershed studies. These studies will provide guidance when 
dealing with any new development within the watershed or subwatershed. 
Subwatershed planning will be supported in areas experiencing urban 
development pressures and in areas where significant environmental 
concerns are identified. Priority areas for subwatershed studies may be 
established in consultation with the Saugeen Valley Conservation Authority. 
Significant findings and recommendations from these studies may result in 
amendments to this Plan. 
5.4.1.4 
Stormwater management techniques are constantly evolving as well as being 
dependent on the location. Thus, new development shall promote the use of 
best management practices and standards as approved by the Town, while 
having regard for Sections 1.2.4 and 2.6. 
5.4.1.5 
Stormwater management studies shall be required for any new residential 
development consisting of more than five lots or for commercial or industrial 
developments with large amounts of impervious area. Such plans may be 
required for other developments, as determined by the Town, if the area has 
existing drainage problems or if runoff could significantly affect adjacent lands 
or water quality. Priority areas for future study include Bruce Road 25. 
Significant findings and recommendations from these studies will be 
considered when reviewing new development proposals.

5.5.1.3 
Schedule A identifies the location of known active or former waste disposal 
sites in the Settlement Area. 
5.5.1.4 
A “Methane Buffer Limit” of 150 metres has been identified around the area of 
landfill on a Solid Waste Management Site at a distance of 150 metres. 
Sensitive land uses will not be permitted within the Methane Buffer Limit, 
unless such buildings or structures are for park, recreation or public purposes 
and unless such buildings or structures have been approved by the Province. 
5.5.1.5 
For any new development or change of use on active and former waste 
disposal sites, or on lands located within 500 metres of these sites, the Town 
may require the applicant to undertake a study, prepared by a qualified 
professional, that evaluates the presence and impact of environmental 
contaminants including, but not necessarily limited to, methane gas and 
leachate migration in soils. The study will address the feasibility of mitigation 
measures if required. If it is found that a potential adverse effect or potential 
risk to health and safety exist, development may be restricted and/or refused. 
5.5.1.6 
Where significant development or change of use is proposed on a waste site 
itself, no development will be permitted to occur until the approval from the 
Province and/or its delegate for the proposed use is obtained in accordance 
with Section 46 of Ontario’s Environmental Protection Act, as amended from 
time to time. 
 
5.6 
TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES 
 
5.6.1 
General Policies 
 
5.6.1.1 
Residents and visitors to Saugeen Shores are increasingly dependent on 
wireless communications to enhance their daily lives from both a business 
and personal perspective. Emergency response services such as 911 also 
rely on wireless communication to reduce response times and ultimately keep 
the Town residents safe. In order to allow better service and increased 
market competition, new telecommunications infrastructure will be required to 
be developed. 
5.6.1.2 
While the authority to regulate telecommunication facilities lies with the 
Federal Government, the Town shall encourage public consultation prior to 
the establishment of new telecommunication facilities. 
5.6.1.3 
It is the policy of the Town to: 
a) encourage facilities to be located away from visually prominent areas 
such as the waterfront or cultural heritage landscapes; 
 
b) encourage service providers to co-locate infrastructure to reduce the 
number of structures across the landscape; 
 
c) encourage service providers to explore opportunities to use existing 
structures to reduce the need to construct new structures; and,

6.4.1 
Council may pass a Pre-Consultation By-law that requires proponents of 
Planning Act applications to consult with the Town prior to the submission of 
an application. The consultation should identify the necessary materials and 
supporting information, including supporting studies, to be provided with an 
application to enable an appropriate review of the application.

6.5.3 
The Town shall discourage the creation of new lots on lands adjacent to the 
Settlement Area that may have a negative impact on the development of 
existing lands or the expansion of settlement boundaries. 
6.5.4 
In order to ensure appropriate services to residents living within the greater 
Saugeen Shores area, the Town may enter into agreements that it finds 
advisable, relating to the sharing of community services. Such Agreements 
may deal with roads servicing, recreation, fire protection, policing, garbage 
disposal and recycling. 
6.6 
DEEMING BY-LAW 
 
6.6.1 
Within the Settlement Area there are plans of subdivision that have been 
deemed not to be registered plans under the Planning Act. 
6.6.2 
The application of the deeming regulations of the Planning Act can be 
advantageously utilized for old plans located within environmentally 
constrained areas or areas without a realistic opportunity for sanitary sewers, 
or where the lot fabric would result in lots that are too small for properly 
functioning septic systems, or where opportunities exist for intensification 
through the creation of smaller lots. 
6.6.3 
The deeming regulations should not be applied if the resulting lot pattern is 
not in keeping with the lot pattern of the established community. When 
applications are made to apply the deeming regulations of the Planning Act, 
Council shall have due considerations to the criteria set out in Section 51(24) 
of the Planning Act and treat the request for deeming in a similar manner as 
the creation of a new lot. As part of the deeming By-law processes the Town 
may require notification of property owners in order to ensure public 
consultation on the impacts of the change in lotting pattern. 
6.7 
DESIGN GUIDELINES 
 
6.7.1 
The Town may adopt design guidelines in accordance with the 
recommendations of the Saugeen Shore design guidelines study. In order to 
implement design guidelines, the Town may pass a By-law pursuant to the 
Planning Act to regulate the exterior design of buildings. 
6.8 
DEVELOPMENT CHARGES BY-LAW 
 
6.8.1 
The Town may undertake a Development Charges Study to determine the 
cost of providing services to new developments, and may implement a 
Development Charges By-Law enabling the recovery of the costs of servicing 
new development.

The Town of Saugeen Shores has the authority to regulate, by By-law, the 
height, material and location of fences. 
6.10 
FINANCE 
 
6.10.1 
This Plan makes reference to a number of Community initiatives under the 
responsibility of the Town. However, the Town should provide and improve 
services in a fiscally responsible manner. 
6.10.2 
It must be understood that the Local Official Plan has a life expectancy of 20 
years and that all of the projects and priorities referred to in the Plan cannot 
be initiated or implemented as soon as the Plan is adopted. 
6.10.3 
It is the intention of the Town, therefore, to only carry out those expenditures 
and public works that are affordable, given the Town’s financial abilities. 
6.10.4 
The Town shall not grant approval to any development unless it is in a 
financial position to provide the services required by such development. 
6.10.5 
The Town shall promote the establishment of a diverse and stable economic 
base both in terms of job opportunities and tax revenue. 
6.10.6

Town may require a Fiscal Impact Assessment to outline anticipated short 
and long term financial impacts on the Town as a result of the proposed 
development. 
6.11 
HOLDING PROVISIONS 
 
6.11.1 
In accordance with the Planning Act, Council may pass a By-law 
incorporating the use of the Holding symbol (H) in conjunction with any zone 
of a Zoning By-law. Where such Holding (H) symbols are indicated, no new 
use may be provided, or building or structure erected on the site unless an 
application is made to remove the (H) symbol and such application is 
approved. 
6.11.2 
It is intended that the Holding (H) symbol be used where the ultimate or 
desired use for specific lands is known, but it is appropriate to delay the 
actual development until such time as certain objectives are met. The 
objective of utilizing a Holding Provision is to ensure that: 
a) the appropriate phasing of development or redevelopment occurs; 
 
b) development does not proceed until services and utilities are available to 
service the development; and/or, 
 
c) agreements respecting the proposed land use or development are 
entered into.

INCENTIVES 
 
6.12.1 
The Town may pass a By-law in accordance with the Planning Act that 
authorizes increases in the height and/or density of a specific development 
proposal permitted under the Zoning By-law, in return for the developer 
providing facilities, services or other matters which are deemed beneficial to 
the community. 
6.12.2 
Increased height and density provisions shall only be awarded to 
developments where adequate municipal services are available and such 
increased height and density does not have a negative impact on surrounding 
lands, uses or places a financial burden on the Town and where one or more 
of the following criteria are fulfilled: 
a) the development provides for assisted housing, seniors housing or 
special need housing in accordance with the identified needs of the 
community; 
 
b) the development incorporates the preservation and restoration of 
buildings of historic or architectural value which will serve to meet the 
cultural heritage objectives of this Plan; 
 
c) the development incorporates a comprehensive redevelopment plan for 
lands within the Core Commercial designation of the Town, which provide 
for the intensification of the land use and serve to reinforce the economic 
viability of the commercial core; 
 
d) the development includes the provision of significant community 
amenities and recreational facilities in locations identified by the Town 
which serve the identified needs of the community as a whole; or 
 
e) the development provides enhanced streetscape and/or landscaping 
features that contribute to civic beautification or “greening” of the 
community. 
 
6.12.3 
The Town may reduce or exempt Development Charges as a form of 
development incentive where it has been demonstrated that the reduction in 
Development Charge would be in the public interest.

LICENSING BY-LAW 
 
6.14.1 
Certain land uses will be subject to licensing requirements as specified in a 
By-law passed by Council under the Municipal Act as the Licensing By-law of 
the municipality. As a condition of granting of a license for a particular use or 
activity, the Town will require that the use conforms to the policies of this Plan 
and is in compliance with the Zoning By-law and any other applicable By-laws 
of the Town. 
6.14.2 
Certain land uses will also have minimum separation distances between the 
use and other land uses considered sensitive or negatively impacted by 
specific uses. Type II Group Homes for criminal code offenders, adult 
entertainment establishments and hazardous land uses may fall within the 
added regulations of both a Zoning By-law and/or licensing requirements. 
6.15 
NON CONFORMING USES 
 
6.15.1 
Intent of the Official Plan 
 
6.15.1.1 
As a general rule, existing uses that do not conform to the policies of this 
Plan should gradually be phased out so that the affected land use may 
change to a use which is in conformity with the goals of the Official Plan and 
the intent of the Implementing Zoning By-law. In some instances, it may be 
necessary and practical to allow the extension or enlargement of non- 
conforming uses where an application for minor variance has been applied 
for and approved or by placing the use in an appropriate zone in the 
implementing Zoning By-law. In such instances, Council shall have regard 
for the following principles: 
a) The feasibility of acquiring the property for holding, sale, lease or 
development by the Town for a more appropriate permitted use; and, 
 
b) The possibility of relocating the non-conforming use to another site. 
 
6.15.2 
Role of the Committee of the Adjustment 
 
6.15.2.1 
If the property cannot be acquired or a building relocated, the Committee of 
Adjustment may, without an Amendment to this Plan, allow an extension or 
enlargement to a non-conforming use. Prior to such approval, the Committee 
shall consider the following: 
a) The size of the extension or enlargement in relation to the existing 
operation; 
 
b) Whether the proposed extension or enlargement is compatible with the 
character of the surrounding area; 
 
c) The characteristics of the existing use in relation to size, bulk, height, 
setbacks, noise, vibration, fumes, dust, smoke, odours, lighting and traffic 
generation and the degree to which any of these factors may be 
increased or decreased by the extension; and,

d) The possibilities of reducing these nuisances through buffering, building 
setbacks, landscaping, Site Plan Control and other means to improve the 
existing situation, as well as minimize the problems from extension. 
 
6.15.3 
Role of the Zoning By-law 
 
6.15.3.1 
Existing uses which do not conform with the policies of this Official Plan may 
be zoned in the Implementing Zoning By-law in accordance with their present 
use, provided that: 
a) the zoning will not permit any change of use or performance standard that 
may negatively impact adjoining uses; 
 
b) the uses do not constitute a danger to surrounding land uses, humans or 
animals by virtue of their hazardous nature; and, 
 
c) the uses do not interfere with the appropriate development of the 
surrounding lands. 
 
6.16 
NOTICE REQUIREMENTS

non-residential development. As an alternative, gross one hectare of land for 
every 300 Residential Unit or Building units for development may be 
dedicated to the Town for parkland purposes. 
6.18.2 
The Town has the option of accepting parkland it deems appropriate or cash- 
in-lieu of parkland as permitted by the Planning Act. 
6.18.3 
Lands having environmental constraints may not be acceptable to the Town 
as parkland.

suitable for use as parkland. 
6.18.5 
Parkland dedication may be required in a manner that contributes to the 
continued development of trail systems in the Town. 
6.19 
PARKING AND CASH-IN-LIEU REQUIREMENTS 
 
6.19.1 
The Comprehensive Zoning By-law contains provisions prescribing a 
minimum number of parking spaces for specific land uses. In some 
circumstances, a development proposal is unable to accommodate the 
required number of parking spaces. 
6.19.2 
If a development is unable to provide enough parking spaces, the Town has 
the authority to offer an exemption from the parking requirements of the 
Comprehensive Zoning By-law, and except a cash payment in-lieu of each 
parking space not provided. 
6.19.3 
The Town may adopt a Cash-in-lieu By-law enabling it to accept cash 
payments in compensation for insufficient parking spaces involving 
development or redevelopment proposals. 
6.19.4 
It is the policy of the Town to consider the payment of cash-in-lieu of parking 
as an effective mechanism for encouraging compact, efficient and viable core 
areas. However, certain lands uses shall be exempt from requirements to 
Town of Saugeen Shores 
Official Plan 
108 
Adopted by Council Dec. 10, 2012 
Approved by Bruce County: March 26, 2014 
 
provide parking or cash-in-lieu thereof as set out in the policies of the Core 
Commercial 
designation 
and 
the 
implementing 
provisions 
of 
the 
Comprehensive Zoning By-law. For those uses that are required to provide 
parking in these areas, the Town may establish a cash-in-lieu fee, which is 
less than the true cost of providing new parking spaces as an incentive to 
development or redevelopment. 
6.19.5 
Monies raised through cash-in-lieu shall be placed in a special reserve fund, 
separate from general revenues, dedicated to managing existing public 
parking resources or for establishing new parking facilities. 
6.19.6 
In order to determine the actual costs for providing a parking space, and the 
appropriate fee to be charged for each space levied, the Town shall 
undertake a parking study.

shall be permitted in any land use designation, except within the 
Environmental Hazard designation, without an amendment to this Plan. The 
utility or company involved should consult the Town regarding the location of 
any and all new facilities. Non-linear facilities not contained totally 
underground will require an amendment to the Zoning By-law and shall be 
directed to the Rural Area. These uses are also discouraged in the Shoreline 
Residential Designation and Core Commercial.

The Town of Saugeen Shores Comprehensive Zoning By-law shall be 
reviewed following the approval of this Plan by the County of Bruce to ensure

ZONING WITH CONDITIONS 
 
6.30.1 
Recent amendments to Section 34 of the Planning Act provide municipalities 
with the authority to implement zoning with conditions. However, at the time 
this Plan was prepared, the necessary Ontario Regulation had not been 
brought into effect by the Province. 
6.30.2 
Subsequent to the enactment of the applicable Regulation, this policy shall 
enable Council to implement zoning with conditions, provided such a By-law 
is used exclusively to facilitate and regulate site alteration and development 
within the adjacent lands to a Natural Heritage Feature or lands Designated 
Environmental Hazard. 
6.30.3 
The consideration of a broader application of zoning with conditions will be 
required through an Official Plan Amendment or an Official Plan Review. 
6.30.4 
Zoning with conditions may be implemented through an agreement registered 
on the title of a property. 
6.31 
Community Planning Permit System 
 
6.31.1 
The Community Planning Permit System will encourage the building of a 
greater variety of homes in existing neighborhoods, using a “gentle density” 
approach while providing transparency and certainty with respect to future 
uses and built form.  The Community Planning Permit System will also 
promote affordable home building, support local priorities while reducing the 
complexity of reviewing development proposals. 
 
6.31.2 
The community planning permit approval framework combines planning 
approvals through Minor Variance, Site Plan Control and Zoning By-law 
Amendments into one permitting system. 
 
6.31.3 
The Town may identify a specific area or properties throughout the Settlement 
Area or choose to enact the entire Settlement Area as a Community Planning 
Permit Area and may be subject to a Community Planning Permit By-law. 
Except for those types of development for which the Community Planning 
Permit By-law specifies that no permit is required, a permit will be required 
prior to undertaking any development or site alteration within the
