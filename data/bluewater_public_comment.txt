Hello 
 
My name is William Clayton and I own a property on Lot # 192, 312 Ridge Street Port Elgin. I would like 
to file my objection to these proposed  amendments for the reasons set out below. 
 
Currently Ridge Street is 100% detached dwelling . This creates a streetscape that the current 
purchasers expected to be maintained. Doubling the density in one small block will have a negative 
impact on the value of all our single family homes. 
 
I would like someone to explain why there is an urgent need to increase density by changing the Ridge 
Street zoning to accommodate 19 townhomes There are already 96 planned  townhouse lots  which 
represents  37% of the development.  Also, there are currently 6 similar townhomes  listed for sale and h 
5 more will  be completed shortly. 
 
If current demographic statistics show a growing need for townhomes why can’t they be planned to be 
built in blocks # 258 & # 259? Block # 258 is closer to similar residential  zoning. Also, if the urgency is 
proved to be real then  there is an option available on Street “A” currently has 16 townhouses proposed. 
Why can’t the requested 19 townhouses be built across the street on lots 24 to 36? These townhouses, 
which are more affordable for young families, would be closer to the daycare facility on Bruce Street. 
 
I would attend the public meeting planned for March 21 St however, my wife and I finally decided to 
take a much-needed holiday which I booked yesterday. We are leaving on March 21st. 
 
Thank you for your attention in this matter.
