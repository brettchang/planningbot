areas of compatible characteristics, and to provide protection for the residents against undesirable 
uses. 
 
AND WHEREAS authority is granted under Section 34 of The Planning Act, 1990, to the Council

The provisions of this By-law shall apply to all those lands lying within the corporate limits 
of the Town of Saugeen Shores. 
 
Existing Use Continued 
 
Nothing in this By-law shall apply to prevent the use of any existing lot, building or structure

purpose prohibited by the provisions of this By-law, if the plans for such building or structure 
were approved by the Corporation and either a building permit was issued or a Site Plan 
Agreement entered into prior to the date of passing of this By-law, so long as:

Compliance with Other Restrictions 
 
a) 
This By-law shall not be construed so as to reduce or mitigate any restrictions or 
regulations lawfully imposed by the Corporation or by any appropriate Approval 
Authority having jurisdiction to make such restrictions or regulations. 
 
b) 
Nothing in this By-law shall exempt any person from complying with the requirements 
of the Building By-law and the Building Code or any other By-law in force with the 
Corporation or from obtaining any license, permission, permit, authority or approval 
required by this or any other By-law of the Corporation unless hereinafter specifically 
stated. 
 
c) 
Nothing in this By-law shall reduce the severity of restrictions lawfully imposed by an 
appropriate Approval Authority having jurisdiction to make such restrictions.

of a permit for a building or structure or change of use of an existing building or structure 
may affect any sewage disposal system, either on the subject land or on adjacent 
lands or any water supply, no building permit shall be issued for such building or 
structure unless the building permit application is accompanied by approval in writing 
from the appropriate Approval Authority for the proposed method of sewage disposal 
and water supply. A Nutrient Management Plan may also be required before any 
permit is issued for a livestock facility.

Timing of Parking Space Provision 
 
Parking spaces shall be provided at the time of erection of any building or structure, at 
the time any building or structure is enlarged or at the time any change of use occurs. 
 
Location and Access 
 
a) 
Parking spaces shall be located on the same lot or within the same building as the 
use for which said parking is required. 
 
However, where the owner of a building or structure proposes to provide the 
required parking spaces and areas in a location other than on the same lot as the 
use that requires such spaces and areas, then such parking shall be located not 
more than 150 m from the said lot and shall be located within the same Zone as 
the said lot. Such parking shall not be considered as required parking for the use 
of the lands upon which the parking spaces are situated. 
 
Should it not be possible to accommodate the required number of parking spaces 
on site or within 150 m of the site, Council may, if appropriate, require the owner 
to enter into an agreement under Section 40 of the Planning Act for the payment 
of cash in lieu of parking. 
 
Parking spaces shall not be provided on Town-owned land or road allowances, 
unless they are parking spaces provided by the Town. 
 
b) 
Access to parking areas shall be provided from a public street unless otherwise 
provided for in a site plan agreement, condominium agreement or registered plan 
of subdivision agreement. 
 
c)

where a Zone boundary is indicated as approximately following lot lines 
shown on a registered plan of subdivision or lot lines of the original Town 
THE TOWN OF SAUGEEN SHORES – Zoning By-Law No. 75-2006 
80 
 
survey fabric, the boundary shall follow such lot lines. 
 
iii) 
where a Zone boundary is indicated as approximately parallel to any street 
line and the distance from the street line is not indicated, such boundary shall 
be construed as being parallel to such street line, and the distance there from 
shall be according to the scale shown on Schedule “A”. 
 
iv) 
where a Zone boundary is indicated as following a shoreline, the boundary 
shall follow such shoreline and, in the event that the shoreline changes, the 
boundary shall be taken as having moved with the shoreline. 
 
v) 
where any Zone boundary is left uncertain after application of the provisions 
of clauses a), b), c) and d) above, then the boundary shall be determined by 
the scale shown on the Zoning Map Schedule measured from the centre of 
the Zone line. 
 
b) 
Wherever it occurs, the municipal limit is the boundary of the Zone adjacent to it; 
 
c) 
The Environmental Protection (EP) Zone boundaries identified on Schedule “A” to 
this By-law are subject to minor changes without a formal amendment to this By- 
law when approved in writing by the appropriate Approval Authority and the Town’s 
Chief Building Official. 
 
4.7 
STREETS AND RIGHTS-OF-WAY 
 
A street, electrical transmission right-of-way, or watercourses shown on Schedule “A”, 
unless otherwise indicated, shall be included within the Zone of adjoining property on 
either side thereof and where such street, right-of-way or watercourse serves as a 
boundary between two or more different Zones, the centre line of such street, right-of- 
way, or watercourse, and extending in the general direction of the long dimension 
thereof, shall be considered the boundary between Zones unless otherwise indicated. 
 
4.8 
MORE THAN ONE ZONE ON A LOT 
 
Where a lot has two or more of its parts classified in different Zones, then the provisions 
for each Zone shall apply to each part as if said part was a separate lot, excepting 
however that where a portion of a property is zoned ‘EP’ such portion may be used to 
satisfy the side yard, rear yard or front yard setback requirements and shall not be treated 
as if it were a separate lot. 
 
4.9 
COMPOUND ZONES 
 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this By-law, where two or more zoning symbols 
divided by a “/” are shown on the zoning maps as applying to a lot or as compounded by 
a Special Provision, that lot may be used exclusively for any use permitted in any one of 
the Zones included in the compound zone symbol, or for any combination of uses 
permitted in any of the zones included in the compound zone symbol, subject to the 
following regulations: 
THE TOWN OF SAUGEEN SHORES – Zoning By-Law No. 75-2006 
81 
 
 
a) 
The site development specifications prescribed in this By-law for the selected Zone 
in the compound Zone symbol in which the use is permitted shall be observed in

TEMPORARY USE ZONES 
 
Where the zone symbol on Schedule “A” is preceded by a “T” and followed by a date, 
such as T-A-3-8-22-2003, the “T” stands for a Temporary Zone as permitted under 
Section 38 of the Planning Act, as amended from time to time. When the time period 
specified within the Zone has passed and if an extension has not been granted by 
Council, the property reverts to the base zone. In the example given, the “A-3” stands for 
the use permitted (a mobile home, for example), and the 8-22-2003 stands for when the 
Zone will cease to be in effect, with the order of the numbers being the month, the day, 
and the year. Once the temporary time period has lapsed, the base Zone would then 
apply.  In the example given the base Zone would be the Agricultural (A) Zone. 
 
 
4.11 
TEMPORARY SECOND DWELLING 
 
In the case where a dwelling is proposed to be constructed, a second dwelling may be 
permitted on any lands within the Town, subject to the provision of the zoning By-law,

TABLE 3 
MINIMUM DISTANCE SEPARATION (MDS I) FROM MANURE STORAGE FACILITY 
 
The following table is used to calculate MDS I requirements in metres from manure storage associated with livestock facilities. 
Using the resulting MDS I distance from Table 2, read across the appropriate line to the column for the applicable manure storage Type 1, 2, 3 or 4.  
Select the distance under the appropriate Land Use Type "A" or "B". 
This is the MINIMUM DISTANCE SEPARATION REQUIREMENT (MDS I) in metres from the manure storage of a livestock facility for the establishment 
of a non-farm use. 
 
MANURE STORAGE TYPE 
 
 
Type 1: 
Roofed or covered storages for manure, runoff, and milkhouse washwater.  Includes any covered or roofed concrete, steel, or 
earthen storages, in-barn solid manure packs, and storages under fully slatted floors. 
 
Type 2: 
Open solid manure pile on concrete slab.  Includes the runoff storages (concrete or earthen) used for capturing seepage liquids from 
solid manure storage or runoff liquids from yards.  If yards are scraped into runoff storage, use Type 3 when runoff storage is a 
concrete or steel tank and Type 4 when runoff storage is earthen.  Milkhouse washwater may be added to runoff storage. 
 
Type 3: 
Open concrete or steel tank used for storing liquid manure or yard runoff when yard is scraped into storage. 
 
Type 4: 
Open earth-sided storage or earth-sided storage with concrete floor to be used for storing liquid manure or yard runoff when yard is 
scraped into storage milkhouse washwater.

Note:  for new livestock farms, or if the % increase is greater than 700 percent, use Factor C=1.14.  If there are less than 3 
years between the issuance dates of 2 or more successive building permits for new or expanded livestock facilities on the 
same legal lot of record, then the percentage increase Factor C shall be based on the combined increase in Livestock Units of 
those facilities named in building permits over that 3 year period, compared to the number of Livestock Units that were 
present in any other facilities before those building permits were issued.
