INTRODUCTION 
1.1 
Study Objectives 
The Town of Saugeen Shores has a complex system for surface water drainage, which includes overland sheet 
flow, natural water courses, municipal drains, tile drains, ditches, culverts and storm sewers.  Certain areas 
occasionally experience some drainage related issues, and, with recent significant land development pressure, 
the Town intends better to understand the drainage systems throughout the municipality in order to appropriately 
plan for future drainage needs.  Although much information has been prepared in the past, the Town identified 
a need to consolidate and update drainage planning information to assist with more fulsome decision making.  
In 2019, GM BluePlan Engineering Limited was retained by the Town of Saugeen Shores to prepare a Master 
Drainage Plan for the Town. 
 
The purpose of the study is to consolidate existing drainage information into a comprehensive document 
complete with a set of maps.  This document will outline the existing and future drainage needs of the Town and 
highlight areas with existing drainage issues.  This information will be used going forward to plan for future 
drainage improvements, including recommendations for policies and capital projects to address the Town’s 
drainage network. 
 
The study objectives primarily include the following: 
 Assemble available data from the Town, including information compiled within their GIS database that 
includes culvert and storm sewer locations and details. 
 Develop Catchment Area Mapping to delineate and map all major catchment areas and flow routes, 
including the trunk drainage infrastructure (B-series of Drawings). 
 Consult with the Town and the Saugeen Valley Conservation Authority (SVCA) to identify and 
document existing drainage issues in each component catchment area.   
 To consider potential impacts of land development on existing drainage systems. 
 To consider alternative solutions, as appropriate, to identified drainage issues including preliminary 
cost estimates for construction. 
 To complete catchment area mapping that presents the recommended solutions to the drainage issues 
identified (C-series of Drawings). 
 To recommend a prioritized list of capital projects for implementation.

1.2 
Study Area 
Drainage within the Town of Saugeen Shores primarily flows either to the Saugeen River or to Lake Huron.  The 
Study Area is bound by the municipal limits of the Town of Saugeen Shores and is subdivided into four main 
Drainage Study Areas, as illustrated on Figure 1-1.  The Town has opted to complete this assessment, by 
following a Master Plan approach, with the Study Area broken down into the following Drainage Study Areas:      
Drainage Study Area No.1:  Southampton North of the River (i.e. Southampton North) 
Drainage Study Area No.2:  Southampton South of the River (i.e. Southampton South) 
Drainage Study Area No.3:  Port Elgin 
Drainage Study Area No.4:  Rural Areas 
 
Each of the four drainage study areas are further divided into component catchment areas (or subcatchments), 
as illustrated on Drawings A-2 through Drawing A-5.  
 
1.3 
Project Scope and Planning  
GMBP was retained by the Town of Saugeen Shores to prepare a Master Drainage Plan for the Town and to 
undertake a planning process towards identifying and addressing the drainage deficiencies within the Town 
limits.  The Town has initiated this Master Plan, under the Municipal Class Environmental Assessment (EA) 
process, appropriately to plan various drainage undertakings within the Study Area in a comprehensive manner.   
 
The Master Drainage Plan, contained within this document, includes a set of maps, which depict the existing 
conditions, presented in the set of B-series drawings and, within the C-series of drawings, present a set of 
preliminary recommended solutions to the drainage issues and future drainage needs identified.  In addition, the 
documentation includes the following: 
i. A description of the project background; 
ii. A consolidation of the findings of various background studies; 
iii. A review of the existing policies, regulations and guidelines; 
iv. Identification of problems and opportunities for component catchments within the drainage system; 
v. Identification of alternative solutions to the identified problems and/or opportunities; 
vi. Evaluation and assessment of alternative drainage solutions; 
vii. A summary of public, agency and indigenous community consultation; and 
viii. The selection of a preferred set of alternative solutions, which make up the Master Plan. 
 
The Master Plan will assist in planning individual projects consistent with a comprehensive drainage strategy 
within the overall study area (i.e. the Town).  This system wide approach provides for a strategic assessment of 
options to better address the needs of the Town’s drainage system and potential impacts/mitigation.  Further, 
this plan identifies specific projects that can be implemented with suggested timelines. 
 
This Master Plan is intended to follow Approach #1 of the Master Planning process (Appendix 4, MCEA Manual 
2015), which involves the completion of a Master Plan document at the conclusion of Phases 1 and 2 of the EA 
process.  The Master Plan is to be made available for public, agency and indigenous community comment prior 
to being approved by the Town.  Upon the selection, by Council, of a Preferred Master Plan for drainage systems 
within the Study Area, individual projects may proceed under the appropriate EA Schedule, using the Master 
Plan as a basis.  The intent of the Master Plan is to complete a broad level of assessment that satisfies the 
requirements for Schedule A/A+ projects, however, requires more detailed project-specific investigations to fulfill 
the requirements for the identified Schedule B and Schedule C projects.  The EA process is detailed in Section 
2 of this Master Plan.

MUNICIPAL CLASS ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT: MASTER PLANS 
 
Municipal infrastructure projects are subject to the Ontario Environmental Assessment Act (EA Act).  The Class 
Environmental Assessment (Class EA) is an approved self-assessment process under the EA Act for a specific 
group or “class” of projects.  Projects are considered approved subject to compliance with an approved Class 
EA process.  The Municipal Class EA (Municipal Engineers Association October 2000, as amended in 2007, 
2011 and 2015) applies to municipal infrastructure projects including roads, water and wastewater. 
 
The Municipal Class EA outlines a comprehensive planning process (illustrated in Figure 2-1) that provides a 
rational approach to consider the environmental and technical advantages and disadvantages of alternatives 
and their trade-offs in order to determine a Preferred Solution (or set of Preferred Solutions) to address an 
identified problem (or opportunity), as well as consultation with agencies, indigenous communities, directly 
affected stakeholders and the public throughout the process.  The key principles of successful environmental 
assessment planning include: 
 Consultation; 
 Consideration of a reasonable range of alternatives; 
 Consideration of effects on natural, social, cultural, and economic environments and technical 
components; 
 Systematic evaluation;  
 Clear documentation; and 
 Traceable decision making. 
 
The classification of projects and activities under the Municipal Class EA is as follows:  
Schedule A: Includes normal or emergency operational and maintenance activities, which are limited in 
scale and have minimal adverse environmental effects.  These undertakings are pre-approved from Part-II 
Orders, and the proponent can proceed without further assessment and approval. 
Schedule A+: Introduced in 2007, these minor projects are pre-approved from Part-II Orders.  The public 
is to be advised prior to the implementation of the project. 
Schedule B: Includes projects which have the potential for adverse environmental effects.  This includes 
improvements to, and minor expansions of, existing facilities.  These projects are approved subject to a 
screening process which includes consulting with stakeholders who may be directly affected, relevant 
review agencies and indigenous communities. 
Schedule C: Includes the construction of new facilities and major expansions to existing facilities. These 
undertakings have the potential for significant environmental effects and must proceed under the planning 
and documentation procedures outlined in the Municipal Class EA document. 
 
Master Plans are long range plans that recognize the need to integrate infrastructure requirements for existing 
and future land uses with environmental assessment planning principles.  As such, Master Plans address Phases 
1 and 2 of the Municipal Class EA process, depicted on Figure 2-1: 
 
 Phase 1 consists of identifying the problem or opportunity, and optional (discretionary) public 
consultation if deemed suitable. 
 
 Phase 2 involves identifying reasonable alternatives to the problem or opportunity, compiling an 
inventory of the natural, cultural, social, technical and economic environments, evaluating each 
alternative and recommending a preferred alternative that will address the problem, and provide any 
measures necessary to mitigate potential environmental impacts.  As part of the Phase 2 process, public, 
agency and indigenous community consultation is required before the preferred solution is selected to 
ensure all possible impacts are identified, and assessed, as part of the evaluation process.

The Master Plan Report will be finalized at the conclusion of Phases 1 and 2 of the EA process (Figure 2-1).  
Project Notices for this Master Plan are provided in Appendix A.  It is noted that, as a Master Plan does not 
require approval under the EA Act, only the individual projects within the Master Plan must fulfill the EA 
requirements.  A description of the process for the individual Schedule B and Schedule C projects identified is 
provided below for reference purposes.   
 
Schedule B and Schedule C EA Projects: Consultation Requirements and Review Period 
For Schedule ‘B’ or ‘C’ projects, a Notice of Study Commencement is advertised and the Preferred Solution (and 
for Schedule ‘C’ projects, the Preferred Design) is developed through the process; to be confirmed by Council.  
The entire process is documented in a Schedule ‘B’ Project File, or Schedule ‘C’ Environmental Study Report, 
which is made available for public, agency and indigenous community review during a 30 calendar day period 
following the issuance of the Notice of Completion.   
 
For Schedule ‘B’ and ‘C’ projects, all comments and concerns raised by the public, stakeholders and/or agencies 
during the review period, following advertisement of the Notice of Completion, are to be addressed directly to 
the proponent (i.e. the Town).  However, if concerns are raised during the review period that are specific to 
aboriginal or treaty rights, that cannot be resolved through discussions with the Town, then a Part-II Order 
request to the Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks (MECP) may be made.  Within the Part II 
Order request, the Minister may be requested to refer the matter to mediation, impose additional project 
conditions, and/or request an elevated scope of study.   
 
The decision whether or not a Part II Order is appropriate or necessary rests with the Minister of the MECP.  If 
no Part II Order request is outstanding by the end of the 30 calendar day review period, the project is considered 
to have met the requirements of the Class EA, and the Town may proceed to design and construction.

BACKGROUND 
3.1 
Description 
On January 30th, 1998, the former Towns of Southampton and Port Elgin together with the former Township of 
Saugeen were amalgamated and formed the new Town of Saugeen Shores.  Historically, the Town of 
Southampton was developed with seasonal recreational properties on rural services (i.e. primarily culverts, 
ditches and natural watercourses).  A downtown commercial district evolved to the south of the Saugeen River, 
following the Highway 21 (Albert Street) and High Street corridors.  The Town of Port Elgin was historically 
developed as a full time/seasonal cottage community with a downtown urban commercial area along Highway 
21 (Goderich Street).  The former Township of Saugeen was, and remains, primarily a rural/agricultural area.  
Following amalgamation, storm and sanitary sewers, as well as municipal water services, were expanded and 
currently extend throughout the majority of the area within the existing ‘Settlement Area’ boundaries established 
for Southampton and Port Elgin. 
 
The Town of Saugeen Shores is entirely within the planning authority of the Saugeen Valley Conservation 
Authority (SVCA), as the Saugeen River meanders through the Town to its outlet at Lake Huron, which is located 
in Southampton.  The Saugeen River has a catchment area of approximately 4,675 km2, most of which is 
upstream of the Town.  Flow monitoring on the Saugeen River has been ongoing since 1914.

3.2 
Geology and Physiography  
The Town of Saugeen Shores is within the Huron Fringe and the Huron Slopes physiographic regions. The 
surficial geology is typically characterized by glaciolacustrine deposits (beaches, sand plains and till plains), with 
coarse-textured deposits found near the shores of Lake Huron and fine-textured deposits associated with the till 
plains located in the southern inland portion of the Town.  Alluvial deposits are found along the banks of the 
Saugeen River.  The Salina formation underlies most of the area, with a small segment of Bass Islands formation 
and Bois Blanc Formation in the very southwestern corner of the Town.  The Salina Formation consists of a unit 
of thin-bedded dolostones and shales. 
 
Based on Soils of Bruce County (Soil Survey of Ontario) and as depicted in Figure 3-1, the majority of the Town 
lands have imperfect or good drainage, with the remainder being either excessive, poor or variable.   
 
FIGURE 3-1: Town of Saugeen Shores - Soil Drainage by Percent Total Area 
 
Generally, a former shoreline bluff rises relatively quickly from the Lake Huron water level to the tablelands 
above.  The tablelands above the bluff are relatively flat, generally providing for flow in an east to west direction 
from a high point east of Goderich Street toward Lake Huron.  The tablelands run parallel to the Lake Huron 
shoreline.  Lands to the east of the high point generally drain easterly but remain within the Saugeen River 
watershed.  In general, very little gradient is available in a north ↔ south direction.   
 
Although the tablelands topography is relatively flat above the bluff, the sandy nature of local soils typically 
permits a degree of infiltration, which helps reduce surface ponding effects in many areas above the bluff.  These 
sandy soils may not be cohesive and, therefore, open channel flows down the bluff may contribute to erosion in 
some areas.  Below the bluff, a system of groundwater contact springs creates wetland areas and watercourses.

PREVIOUS DRAINAGE STUDIES 
 
Several drainage studies have been previously completed for specific areas within the Town including, but not 
limited to, the following:  
i. 
Drainage Study Area No.1:  Southampton North 
Master Drainage Plan, Special Policy Area No.2 (Area North of the Saugeen River), Town of 
Southampton (March 1996).  Prepared by Gamsby and Mannerow Limited. 
This investigation delineated the catchments and drainage routes within Drainage Study Area No.1 and 
identified capital projects to address immediate drainage concerns and future development.   
ii. 
Drainage Study Area No.2: Southampton South 
The Town of Southampton Floodline Mapping Study, Saugeen Valley Conservation Authority (April 
1991) and the Town of Southampton Flood Control Study, Saugeen Valley Conservation Authority 
(1992).  Prepared by The LATHEM Group Inc.  
These studies identified floodline elevations, delineated catchment areas and identified channel spills.  
Major and minor flow directions were investigated in the area to the south of the Saugeen River within 
Southampton.  
iii. 
Drainage Study Area No.3: Port Elgin 
Drainage planning for the Concession 10, Market Street and Bruce Road 25 catchments was previously 
completed under Municipal Class Environmental Assessment processes.  Several other catchments 
within the Port Elgin Drainage Area have previously been planned, in part, through Plans of Subdivision.  
In addition, the Gore Municipal Drain provides drainage for a catchment situated at the south end of Port 
Elgin.  
 
In addition, several smaller scale drainage studies have been completed for specific areas or developments 
within the Town of Saugeen Shores, as required components of residential development or capital works 
projects. 
 
5. 
EXISTING POLICIES 
 
There are several policies, regulations and guidelines that are considered as part of the identification of drainage 
issues within the Town, as well as with the proposed improvements/recommendations.  A summary of some of 
the policies and guidelines that are considered to be relevant to this Master Drainage Plan is provided in this 
Section.  It is noted that policies and guidelines are typically revised (or updated) on a regular basis.  The most 
current documents should be referenced during the planning design and construction phases for any given 
project.   
 
5.1 
Provincial Policy Statement (PPS, 2020) 
The Provincial Policy Statement, which is issued under Section 3 of the Planning Act, provides policy direction 
pertaining to land use planning and development.  In essence, all decisions affecting planning matters within the 
Town should be consistent with the PPS.  As such, the policies of the PPS are complimented by the Bruce 
County Official Plan and Town’s Official Plan.  Further, the lower tier governments are responsible for the 
implementation of the provincial policies through their Official Plan and planning related decisions.      
 
The PPS provides Natural Hazard Policies (PPS Section 3.1) which guides the land use and development in the 
areas where a risk to public health or property damage from flooding and/or erosion hazards are possible.  In

PAGE 9 OF 73 
general, development is not permitted in hazard lands adjacent to rivers, streams and small inland lake systems 
which are impacted by flooding hazards and/or erosion hazards.   
 
The PPS supports appropriate development while protecting resources of Provincial interest, public health and 
safety, and the quality of the natural and built environment.  Section 1.6.6.7 of the PPS outlines planning 
requirements for stormwater and states the following: 
Planning for stormwater management shall: 
a) Be integrated with planning for sewage and water services and ensure that systems are optimized, 
feasible and financially viable over the long term; 
b) Minimize, or, where possible, prevent increases in contaminant loads; 
c) Minimize erosion and changes in water balance, and prepare for the impacts of a changing climate 
through the effective management of stormwater, including the use of green infrastructure; 
d) Mitigate the risks to human health, safety, property and the environment; 
e) Maximize the extent and function of vegetative and pervious surfaces; and  
f) 
Promote stormwater management best practices, including stormwater attenuation and re-use, water 
conservation and efficiency, and low impact development. 
 
5.2 
County of Bruce Official Plan 
As an upper tier government, Bruce County establishes land use planning policies in the Bruce County Official 
Plan (June 2010).  The purpose of the Bruce County Official Plan is to establish a policy framework to guide 
physical, social and economic development of the County, while protecting the natural environment.  Each of the 
lower tier municipalities also have their own local Official Plans, however, the majority of these local plans only 
apply to the primary and secondary communities, not including all other lands within the municipality.  Further, 
the local Official Plans (i.e. municipal level), including the policies and schedules, must conform to the provisions 
of the upper tier Official Plan (i.e. the County).   
 
The Town of Saugeen Shores does not have a comprehensive local Official Plan that applies to its entire 
geographic area.  In other words, the Town’s Official Plan only applies to the lands in the Settlement Area of 
Saugeen Shores.  Therefore, as per Section 2.2.5 of the Bruce County Official Plan, the County Plan also 
functions as the local Official Plan for the Town, specifically for the areas outside of the Town’s Settlement Area 
Boundary (i.e. Southampton and Port Elgin).  A copy of the Towns Land Use Plan (i.e. Schedule A of the Official 
Plan) showing the settlement area boundaries is provided in Appendix B.       
 
Surface water management planning provisions are outlined in Section 4.13 of the County Official Plan, which 
states the following:  
.1  In order to control flooding, ponding, erosion and sedimentation and to protect, as much as possible, 
water quality and aquatic habitat or other natural habitat which depend upon watercourses and other 
water bodies for their existence, surface water management plans (or stormwater management plans) 
shall be required for some forms of new development. Stormwater management techniques are 
constantly evolving as well as being dependent on the location. Thus, new development will comply 
with the stormwater management standards in general acceptance at the time a development 
application is made, through consultation with the appropriate Government agencies. 
.2  Local Official Plans should implement specific surface water management policies. 
.3  Surface water management plans shall be required for any new development consisting of more than 
five lots or for commercial or industrial developments with large amounts of impervious area. 
.4  Such plans may be required for other developments, as determined by the local municipality in 
consultation with the appropriate Government agencies, if the area has existing drainage problems or 
if runoff could significantly affect adjacent lands or water quality.

5.3 
Town of Saugeen Shores Official Plan 
The Town’s most recent Official Plan was adopted by Council December 10, 2012.  The Official Plan has a 20-
year horizon and the current plan is expected to remain applicable until 2031.  The Official Plan is updated about 
every 10-years.  The Town is currently undergoing an Official Plan review. 
 
The Stormwater Management Policies are outlined in Section 5.4 of the Official Plan (2012), a copy of this section 
is included in Appendix B.  The Official Plan (as amended) should be referenced for complete and current 
policies.  As a general summary, any development proposal may be required to include stormwater management 
measures to control any increase in development-related runoff to downstream drainage systems (watercourses 
or storm sewers), up to and including the 100-year design storm.  Consistent with the Bruce County Official Plan, 
stormwater management studies are required for any new residential development consisting of more than five 
lots, or for commercial or industrial developments with large impervious areas. 
 
Section 5.4.1.3 states that consideration should also be given to the recommendations of any watershed and 
subwatershed studies.  Subwatershed planning will be supported in areas experiencing urban development 
pressures and in areas where significant environmental concerns are identified. 
 
This Master Drainage Plan will provide a review and assessment of the drainage system on a watershed scale, 
with consideration for the component catchment areas (i.e. subwatersheds) where drainage concerns have been 
identified.  This study will also reference some, but not necessarily all, watershed and subwatershed studies that 
previously were completed for areas within the Town of Saugeen Shores. 
  
5.4 
Stormwater Management Planning and Design Manual (MOE, 2003) 
The Stormwater Management Planning and Design Manual (Ministry of the Environment, 2003) provides 
technical and procedural guidance for the planning, design and review of stormwater management practices for 
conveyance of flow, stormwater management and stormwater quality control.  It presents an integrated approach 
to stormwater management that can be applied at the individual lot level, those which form part of the conveyance 
system and controls that may serve multiple lots but are only suitable for small drainage areas (i.e. less than 2 
hectares).  It provides practical guidance for lot level and conveyance controls and their suitability for mitigating 
the impacts of urban development and end-of-pipe control.  Lot level and conveyance controls are required to 
maintain the groundwater and baseflow characteristics to the greatest extent possible.  End-of-pipe controls, 
which receive water from a conveyance system and discharge to a receiving water body, are usually required 
for flood and erosion control and water quality improvement.  Although end-of-pipe controls are typically used to 
service numerous lots or whole subdivisions, lot level and conveyance controls can reduce the size and end-of-
pipe facilities required.        
 
Storm sewer systems, stormwater management facilities and stormwater control facilities each require 
Environmental Compliance Approval (ECA) from the MECP.  These approvals should be maintained, and 
conditions addressed, as required.    
 
5.5 
Drainage Act: Agricultural Tile Drains 
Drainage tiles have been installed on private agricultural lands throughout the Town.  The Ontario Ministry of 
Agriculture and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA) compiles information regarding tile drains which is available via Land 
Information Ontario and was included in the mapping completed as part of this Master Plan.  It is noted that 
drainage tile information did not provide the outlet or direction of flow of the drainage tiles.

PAGE 11 OF 73 
Under the Drainage Act, water that flows naturally must be allowed to flow, and therefore riparian landowners 
who own lands abutting a watercourse, must allow the water to flow.  Riparian landowners have the right of 
drainage, but if they modify or interfere with the channel, they can be held liable for damages.  On the other 
hand, surface water has no right of drainage, does not have to be accepted by lower landowners, and lower 
landowners can build berms, for example, to protect their property.  To allow drainage of non-riparian land, 
Municipal Drains may be established as “petition” or “requisition” drains, or private legal agreements called 
“mutual agreement” drains may be established.  
 
Tile drains are considered to collect surface water.  Tile drains on riparian land that outlet to a natural watercourse 
are legally permitted to do so.  If a tile drain discharges to a lower landowner’s property and not a watercourse, 
including roadside ditches which are not considered to be watercourses, the other landowner is not legally 
required to receive the surface water.  If the water is collected and deposited on lower lands, including using tile 
drains, damages from that water could be grounds for a dispute. 
 
If surface water is collected and deposited on lower land uncontested for 20 years, it may acquire a “Prescriptive 
Right.”   Only a judge can grant a prescriptive right of drainage.  Any changes to the collection of the water may 
result in the prescriptive rights being lost.   
 
Tile drains are not designed to limit peak flow to pre-implementation levels and may increase peak flow rates 
during storm events.  As the owners of the municipal roadside ditches, the Town may decide what outlets to 
ditches are permitted and should reach appropriate agreements for the outlets that are permitted.  Tile drain 
outlets to municipal roadside ditches may be required to limit flow rates through the use of stormwater 
management facilities, or may not be approved, as determined by the Town of Saugeen Shores. 
 
5.6 
Saugeen Valley Conservation Authority (SVCA) 
The principle mandate of the SVCA is ‘to prevent loss of life, property damage and social disruption from flood 
and erosion processes and the conservation of local ecosystems’.  Accordingly, environmental planning and 
regulations are reportedly the two most effective measures in providing and maintaining a well balanced healthy 
watershed.  Their role is to ensure that the natural environment and natural hazards are respected, protected, 
avoided and/or accommodated.  This is achieved through the conservation authorities 'Development Interference 
with Wetlands and Alteration to Shorelines and Watercourses Regulation' (Ontario Regulation 169/06) where 
permits are reviewed and issued for appropriate works in appropriate locations.   
 
In addition, Section 5.5 of the Environmental Planning and Regulations Policies Manual (approved May 16, 2017 
and amended October 16, 2018) outlines stormwater management practices and states the following: 
Stormwater management (SWM) plans are required to meet the standards and criteria set out in the 
Stormwater Management Planning and Design Manual, Ministry of the Environment, March 2003, as 
may be revised, in addition to requirements/recommendations of any relevant watershed or 
subwatershed study.  Stormwater management facilities normally require a permit under Ontario 
Regulation 169/06 as part of approval of their outlet to a watercourse.’ 
 
5.7 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) 
The fish and fish habitat within Lake Huron and the Saugeen River and some of its tributaries are protected 
under the Federal Fisheries Act (1985, as amended).  The Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) 
administers provisions to protect habitat which address threats to fish from habitat loss/degradation and changes 
to natural flow regimes.  The Fish and Habitat Protection Program aims to conserve existing fish and fish habitat, 
protect these resources against future impacts and restore fish habitat, where possible.  The DFO ensures

PAGE 12 OF 73 
compliance for development projects taking place in and around fish habitat under the Fisheries Act and the 
Species at Risk Act (SARA). 
5.7.1 Federal Fisheries Act 
Section 35(1) of the Fisheries Act states that ‘no person shall carry out any work or undertake activity that results 
in serious harm to fish that are part of a commercial, recreational or Aboriginal fishery, or fish that support such 
a fishery’.  Serious harm to fish is defined as the death of a fish or any permanent alteration to, or destruction of, 
fish habitat.  Fish habitat refers to a complex of physical, chemical and biological conditions that provide life 
supporting and reproductive needs of a species or life stage of fish.  In other words, those areas upon which fish 
depend in order to meet their requirements for spawning, rearing, food supply and migration.  Therefore, as per 
the Fisheries Act, a DFO letter of authorization would be required for any project alternative that would cause 
serious harm to fish and/or result in a permanent alteration to fish habitat.   
 
In general, waterbodies that do not require DFO review include, but may not be limited to, artificial waterbodies 
that are not connected to a waterbody that contains fish at any time during any given year, such as private ponds, 
commercial ponds, stormwater management facilities, irrigation ponds or channels, agricultural drains and 
drainage ditches, roadside drainage ditches, quarries and aggregate pits. Therefore, with respect to this Master 
Drainage Plan, projects that may be exempt from DFO review would include the following: 
Culverts: 
a. Maintenance: Where flooding, increased sediment and fish stranding can be prevented, or mitigated. 
b. Repairs: Assuming existing conditions, below the high water mark, is maintained (i.e. same footprint 
and no new fill).   
c. Replacement or Removal: Exempt subject to the following provisions 
i. No channel re-alignment, narrowing or fill added below the high water mark. 
ii. Provides for fish passage (i.e. no obstruction during timing windows). 
iii. Work can be completed in isolation of flowing water. 
Stormwater and Wastewater Management: 
a. New stormwater management facility. 
b. Outfalls (Construction, Repair and Removal): Assuming no increase in footprint or addition of fill 
below the high water mark. 
c. Drainage Channels (Construction and Clean-out):  Assuming work is completed under dry or frozen 
conditions and that clean-out has occurred in the past 10 years.   
 
Projects that may require DFO review would include the installation of a new culvert or bridge, specifically a new 
or replacement structure that will encroach into the watercourse or, in the case of replacement, further into the 
watercourse than the existing structure (i.e. an increase in the footprint below the high water mark). 
 
5.7.2 Species at Risk Act 
The Fish and Fish Habitat Protection Policy Statement explains the fish and fish habitat protection provisions of 
the Fisheries Act and outlines how the DFO will implement these provisions.  If an aquatic species at risk or its 
critical habitat are also affected by the project, the authorization will also act as a Species at Risk Act (SARA) 
permit and will contain terms and conditions to minimize impacts on the species and its critical habitat. 
 
The DFO has prepared aquatic species at risk maps and provides an online mapping tool to determine where 
at-risk populations occur in Canada and where their critical habitat is located.  A map showing the general area 
where SAR have been identified in provided in Appendix C.  Based on the information provided, there are a 
total of four species at risk identified at various locations within the Town, including one threatened species (i.e. 
the Blackhorse Fish) and three species of concern including Rainbow Mussels, the Northern Brook Lamprey and 
the Silver Lamprey.

PROBLEM/OPPORTUNITY STATEMENT 
 
Phase I of the Class EA process involves the preparation of a problem/opportunity statement to guide the 
decision making process for existing drainage issues and future drainage needs, the problem/opportunity 
statement is as follows: 
 
The Town of Saugeen Shores has a complex system for surface water drainage, which includes 
overland sheet flow, natural water courses, municipal drains, tile drains, ditches, culverts and storm 
sewers.  With recent significant land development pressure, the Town is taking a pro-active approach 
to better understand the existing drainage systems in order to appropriately plan for future drainage 
needs.  The Town has identified some areas where drainage deficiencies are apparent, including 
capacity issues, aging infrastructure and flooding.  Further, in consideration of the Town’s urban 
development and projected future growth, opportunities exist to improve the level of service provided 
by existing drainage systems, improve water quality, improve water balance conditions and reduce 
flooding and erosion. Thereby, maintaining the ecological health of the receiving water bodies and 
improving public safety.   
 
Although drainage information has been prepared for specific watersheds within Saugeen Shores, the Town 
identified a need to consolidate and update the available drainage related planning information.  This Master 
Plan will assist staff and Council with more fulsome decision making when reviewing development applications 
and planning capital projects.  The purpose of the study is to consolidate a variety of existing drainage plans into 
a comprehensive set of maps and to document the existing and future drainage needs.  It will identify areas with 
existing drainage issues and will analyze future drainage improvements, including recommendations for policies 
and capital projects.   
 
Upon completion of this Master Drainage Plan, the Town will be able to identify drainage issues and future needs 
for a specific area (or component catchment) in order to determine a reasonable approach for the implementation 
of drainage improvements.  This will ensure that the Town’s existing storm management system will be 
maintained, and recommended projects can be progressively initiated, in a manner that best achieves the Town’s 
engineering and development standards.  
 
7. 
INVENTORY OF ENVIRONMENTS 
 
The Study process includes the preparation of an inventory of environments.  The inventory establishes the 
criteria against which alternative solutions for each specific project (or component catchment) can be assessed.  
Using these criteria, alternative solutions to specific problems or opportunities are considered and assessed 
within this Master Plan, and preliminary recommended solutions are provided. 
7.1 
Natural Environment 
7.1.1 Regulatory Requirements 
As discussed in Section 5.6 of this Master Plan, the watercourse system within the Study Area is regulated by 
the Saugeen Valley Conservation Authority (SVCA) under Ontario Regulation 169/06: Regulation and 
Development, Interference with Wetlands and Alterations to Shorelines and Watercourses.  Under this regulation 
a permit (or permits) will be required from the SVCA prior to undertaking any alterations or development within 
the SVCA regulated areas.

Further, depending on the location and nature of the proposed works, approvals may also be required from the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO).  A DFO letter of authorization is required for any project 
alternative that may result in a permanent alteration to fish habitat.  The Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources 
and Forestry (MNRF) may also need to be consulted.  
 
7.1.2 Source Water Protection  
Recent amendments to the EA Process require proponents to consider whether the project is located within a 
Source Water Protection Vulnerable Area and, if so, to document whether any project activities are a prescribed 
drinking water threat.  As part of the EA process, this project was reviewed with respect to the requirements 
under the Clean Water Act, 2006.  The study area is located within the Saugeen Valley Source Protection Area 
and falls under the Saugeen-Grey Sauble-Northern Bruce Peninsula Source Protection Plan.  Based on the 
Saugeen, Grey Sauble and Northern Bruce Peninsula Source Protection Vulnerable Areas Mapping Application 
and a review of the Source Water Protection Area, part of the Study Area, specifically the area between the north 
side of the Saugeen River to the southerly extent of North Shore Road in Port Elgin, from inland (i.e. to the east 
of Highway 21) out into Lake Huron, is situated within an Intake Protection Zone IPZ-1 (120 meter shoreline 
buffer) or IPZ-2 (i.e. a 2-hour time of travel capture zone) and has an intake vulnerability score in the range of 4 
to 6.  This area is also identified as an Events Based Policy Area (EBA) where the threshold for on-site storage 
of fuel is in the range of 13,000L to 22,500L.  Relevant Drinking Water Source Protection Mapping is included in 
Appendix C.  
 
Projects occurring within the Source Protection Area should consider whether Source Water Protection could be 
an issue, and the SVCA Risk Management Office should be consulted, as appropriate.  It is recommended for 
Schedule B projects that fall within the Source Water Protection Area, that consultation with the SVCA Risk 
Management Office be completed as part of the planning process.   
 
7.1.3 Climate Change 
The natural environment also includes potential impacts of the project on Climate Change, and of Climate 
Change on the project.  At this time, climate change has reportedly resulted in increased localized rainfall and 
extreme rainfall events which are reportedly having an impact on urban drainage infrastructure and in municipal 
areas.  Provided that individual drainage projects intend to address and improve upon existing drainage issues, 
provisions for improvements to the drainage system may simultaneously address the effects of climate change 
on the project, such as the deficiency in local capacity due to the effects of climate change, namely increased 
flows.  While it is difficult to predict the overall effects of climate change on the existing and proposed drainage 
infrastructure, future work should account for the effects of climate change and include adaptations, where 
possible.   
 
7.2 
Cultural Environment 
7.2.1 Archaeological Assessment 
The Ministry of Heritage, Sport, Tourism and Culture Industries (MTC) administers the 2011 Standards and 
Guidelines for Consultant Archaeologists (S&G).  As outlined in Section 1.3.1 of the S&G, the criteria that are 
indicative of archaeological potential generally include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 Water sources (primary, secondary and features indicating past water sources) 
 Accessible or inaccessible shoreline (e.g. high bluffs, swamp or marsh fields by the edge of a lake, etc.) 
 Elevated topography and/or distinctive land formations (e.g. eskers, drumlins, plateaux, waterfalls, rock 
outcrops) 
 Early historic transportation routes 
 Proximity to early settlements

PAGE 15 OF 73 
 
The MTC has developed a checklist to aid in evaluating whether a property or project area may contain 
archaeological potential.  The assessment area should include the main project area and all areas expected to 
be disturbed by construction activities (i.e. storage, staging and working areas and temporary roads and detours).  
It is recommended that the ‘Criteria for Evaluating Archaeological Potential’ checklist, be completed as part of 
projects where the extensive ground disturbance is anticipated.  It is expected that the checklist will be updated 
by the MTC in 2020.   
   
7.2.2 Built Heritage Resource and Cultural Landscape Assessment 
Section 2(d) of the Planning Act necessitates ‘the conservation of features of significant architectural, cultural, 
historical, archeological or scientific interest’.  In Ontario, the conservation of the inheritance of historically and 
architecturally significant properties is primarily a municipal matter.  The Ontario Heritage Act (OHA) provides a 
framework within which municipalities can ensure the conservation of properties of cultural heritage value or 
interest.   
 
The Town of Saugeen Shores recognizes the importance of conservation and provides cultural heritage policies 
in Section 1.2.5 and Section 2.4 of its Official Plan.  The goal of the Plan is ‘to identify, conserve and enhance 
the town’s cultural heritage resources whenever practical and to encourage all new development and 
redevelopment to respect important cultural heritage features’.  The goal is also to ‘identify and conserve built 
heritage resources, heritage properties, heritage attributes, cultural heritage landscapes and archaeological 
resources’.  
 
The MTC has developed a checklist to aid in evaluating whether a property or project area is a recognized 
heritage property or may be of cultural heritage value.  The assessment area should include the main project 
area and all areas expected to be disturbed by construction activities (i.e. storage, staging and working areas 
and temporary roads and detours).  It is recommended that the ‘Criteria for Evaluating Potential for Built Heritage 
Resources and Cultural Heritage Landscapes’ checklist, be completed, as needed.  It is expected that this 
checklist will be updated by the MTC in 2021.       
 
7.3 
Social Environment 
The social environment includes the interests of directly and indirectly affected public members in the usage of 
the built facility.  Potential construction impacts to directly affected public members will be addressed as part of 
the consultation process, which for Schedule A and Schedule A+ projects will be considered to be completed as 
part of this Master Plan.  Additional consultation will be required for the Schedule B projects identified herein.  
The following summarizes a general inventory of the Social Environment:  
 
Impacts to private property, such as potential flooding threats to residences, access limitations and 
implications on land use. 
 
Land acquisition and/or municipal easements. 
 
Aesthetic impacts of drainage improvements. 
 
In general, any drainage improvement alternatives that will prevent and/or reduce flooding or erosion on private 
property will positively impact property values, water quality and/or public safety.  As such, the alternatives 
considered should mitigate, or improve, the conveyance of both minor and major storm flows.  In addition, the 
installation of safety grates on storm sewer and culvert inlets and outlets typically improves public safety.  
Therefore, the installation of safety grates is recommended, as practicable.

7.4 
Technical Environment 
The technical environment includes consideration of design standards and constructability.  Maintenance and 
asset ownership may also be considered.  Improvements proposed to the drainage system are also evaluated 
based on flood and erosion protection.  The following generally summarizes an inventory of the technical 
environment: 
 General technical considerations which includes, but is not limited to, the capacity of the proposed 
drainage infrastructure, protection from flooding and erosion and/or relative maintenance requirements 
of the drainage system, as applicable. 
 Efficacy of design which covers project constructability and minimization of drainage infrastructure, while 
addressing the identified issues and/or opportunities. 
 Consideration of drainage infrastructure for minor (5-year to 10-year return frequency) and major (100-
year return frequency) rainfall run-off events. 
 The ability to address identified drainage issue(s). 
 Project timing.  
 
7.4.1 Regulatory Framework 
Land development planning processes, such as Plan of Subdivision and Site Plan Approvals, permit the Town 
to ensure potential drainage impacts due to land development are identified and adequately addressed.  Further, 
drainage and stormwater management may be regulated by the SVCA via development permits and/or the 
MECP through an ECA process.  In addition, Indigenous Communities are to be consulted regarding any 
proposals to utilize lands under their land claims. 
 
7.4.2 Drainage and Stormwater Management: General Considerations 
Drainage is generally defined as the ability to convey water along a path of travel to a suitable outlet, whether by 
natural systems, or constructed channels or pipes.  Stormwater management generally refers to constructed 
facilities designed to control the quantity and/or quality of drainage, either to offset potential impacts as a result 
of development or to reduce the size of downstream drainage infrastructure. 
 
In general, within the Town lands, very little grade is available in a north to south direction.  Consequently, 
although drainage for minor runoff events may reasonably be defined above the bluff, drainage for major runoff 
events may be less defined due to the occurrences of spills from one catchment to another.  In many instances, 
roadside ditches in the rural areas do not provide a clear drainage divide and high flows may spill from one 
catchment to the next.  It is typically recommended that clear separation of drainage be established by installing 
berms within the ditches at the locations where drainage divides between component catchments exist.  In this 
manner, stormwater flows may be managed on a more predictable and consistent basis.  However, this may not 
be technically achievable in some areas, and should be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.   
 
7.4.3 Drainage System and Design Guidelines 
Storm sewer systems are typically designed as a ‘minor system’ intended to convey the 1:5-year design flows.  
Overland flow routes, such as watercourses, road surfaces, and open channels, are commonly considered to be 
a ‘major system’ and are typically designed to convey the 1:100-year design or Regional flood flow.  Flooding of 
existing buildings and/or adjacent properties should be eliminated, where feasible.  The drainage infrastructure 
must provide sufficient capacity for the continued conveyance of the Regional flood flow downstream to an 
appropriate outlet.

Highway drainage system design criteria are outlined in Section 1.1 of the Highway Drainage Design Standards 
(MTO, January 2008).  These guidelines also act as the basis for the development of drainage alternatives.  
Road culvert crossings and road elevations should be designed, at minimum, to satisfy these design criteria.  
However, it is noted that the Town may develop Town-specific storm drainage and storm management design 
guidelines.  In such a scenario, the Town-specific guidelines should be referenced.  The MTO design criteria, 
which can be used as a guideline, are outlined in Table 7-1.

Some components of the existing drainage infrastructure may be reaching the end of their service life.  In 
consideration of historic design practices which often used a 2-year return storm design criteria, historic rainfall 
data trends which show a general increase, and current climate change models which suggest an increased 
frequency and intensity of significant rainfall events, some of the aging storm sewers may be undersized.  
Therefore, it is recommended that increasing the conveyance capacity of the local storm sewers be considered 
as part of future stormwater management projects.    
 
In general, stormwater management systems can be considered to either control flows or allow drainage to flow 
in an ‘uncontrolled’ system.  In an un-controlled drainage system, the peak of runoff generally occurs only for a 
relatively short duration.  In a controlled drainage system (i.e. a stormwater management pond) a volume of the 
runoff water is temporarily held back and released at a ‘lower than peak rate’, but for an extended period.  A 
longer discharge duration may adversely affect erodible soils, which may need additional consideration. 
 
7.4.4 Design Rainfall Data 
Flows considered for design purposes generally are calculated as the peak of runoff, from a contributing area 
with certain characteristics, due to a rainfall event with a statistical reoccurrence frequency, based on recorded 
rainfall data.  Road crossing culverts are typically designed to convey the peak runoff from a 1:25-year return 
rainfall event (25-year design flow).  Storm sewer systems are typically designed to convey, with no surcharge, 
the peak runoff from a 1:5-year return rainfall event (5-year design flow).  These storm sewer systems may 
convey more than the 5-year design flow under surcharged conditions.  Overland flow routes designed to convey 
surplus runoff from the 100-year design flow generally convey flows in excess of the drainage system capacity. 
 
In general, Douglas Point intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves were used to model rainfall events in the 
Town of Saugeen Shores prior to 2012.  Currently, as specified in the Town of Saugeen Shores Engineering 
Manual, Goderich IDF curves are to be used to model rainfall events. The Goderich IDF curves were most 
recently updated February 27, 2019 and used continuous data from 1970 to 2016.  The coefficients for a 6-hour 
storm are listed in Table 7-2 below.  The Goderich IDF data generally yields greater design flows than the 
previously used Douglas Point IDF data.

The Regulatory Flood Event Standard is Hurricane Hazel.  The Saugeen Valley Conservation Authority considers 
this historic rainfall event for flood line mapping purposes. 
 
 
7.4.5 Outlet Conditions 
Outlet conditions may be influenced by a variety of factors including high or low water levels, sand migration, 
and debris.  High water levels may impose restriction upon outlet capacity if a portion of the outlet becomes 
submerged.  Low water levels may require longer overland flow length at an outlet before reaching the receiving 
water body.  Wave action and wind conditions can cause beach sand to migrate, which may fill in and/or re-route 
an outlet channel across a beach environment.  Similarly, floating debris including tree branches can become 
lodged in an outlet, affecting the flow environment.  The Town of Saugeen Shores has completed several studies 
of their beach environments and has developed monitoring and maintenance programs to address these 
situations as they arise. 
 
7.4.6 Drainage System Maintenance 
The management of municipal infrastructure assets, such as the Town’s drainage management system, via long-
term planning and on-going monitoring and maintenance, is critical to system performance and efficiency.       
 
Lack of maintenance can be one of the main reasons for poor system performance.  During the first two years 
of operation, inspections after significant storms will ensure the system is functioning properly.  After this, annual 
system inspections are usually done to identify maintenance needs.  In general, routine maintenance of ditches, 
culverts, stormwater management facilities, and storm sewers throughout the Town should be completed on an 
annual, bi-annual, or as-needed basis.  Stormwater management facilities should be maintained in accordance 
with their respective ECA approval.   With respect to culvert maintenance and clean-out, it is noted that if greater 
than 10 years has lapsed since the last maintenance was completed, the works may be subject to DFO review.        
 
Clearing obstructions (i.e. blockages from inlets and outlets), completing repairs, and removing debris, sediment 
and unhealthy vegetation are routine maintenance activities that need to be completed.  It is noted that water 
quality improvement within a stormwater management facility is often based primarily on settling of sediment.  
Therefore, at some point, accumulated material will need to be removed. 
 
Although the maintenance frequency may be variable, depending on the volume and intensity of flows received 
within a given system and the age of the infrastructure, it is recommended that a maintenance schedule be 
established to ensure that the inspections and clean-outs are completed, as required to ensure the proper 
function of the system.  As the existing drainage infrastructure reaches the end of its service life and deteriorates, 
the maintenance costs typically increase.       
 
With the implementation of the recommended drainage improvements it is expected that peak flows will be better 
attenuated, erosion and flooding potential will be reduced, and water quality will be improved.  Ultimately, as 
drainage improvements are achieved, the maintenance costs associated with these systems can be expected 
to decrease.

7.4.7 Drainage Considerations: Common Law 
The Ministry of Agriculture and Food prepared a Factsheet, which outlines Common Law Aspects of Water 
(1993).  Some of the issues of interest are summarized in the following paragraphs.  These should not be 
construed as legal advice but are considered to provide general context.  
 
A watercourse is defined generally as a stream of water, which flows along a defined channel, with bed and 
banks, for a sufficient time to give it substantial existence.  This may include intermittent streams that dry up 
periodically.  Watercourses within the Study Area may be subject to Riparian Rights.  These rights include the 
right to drain lands that abut the watercourse into the natural stream, with ditches and drains, even though it 
results in an increase in the volume or rate of flow.  Riparian property owners are entitled to receive water flowing 
in its natural state (both quantity and quality) and, thereto, are required to accept the natural state of flowing 
water, even if flooding conditions occur.  A riparian owner cannot sell or assign the right to drain to a natural 
watercourse. 
 
Surface water not flowing in a natural watercourse has no right of drainage.  An owner of lower land may, at his 
or her own choice, either allow the water from higher land to flow over it, or by dams or banks keep such water 
off his or her property.  No owner has the right to collect such surface water by ditches or drains and discharge 
it on lands of another.  He or she has the responsibility to take this water to a sufficient outlet (i.e., a natural 
watercourse or a drain constructed under The Drainage Act).  For a municipality this means that, once water is 
collected in ditches or storm sewers, they cannot simply discharge it onto another property and should take 
responsibility to ensure the water is taken to a sufficient outlet. 
 
7.4.8 Existing Infrastructure 
Utilities including, but not limited to, sanitary sewers, water main, hydro, gas, telephone and cable TV are present 
throughout the Town.  Conflicts with existing utilities should be reviewed and addressed as part of the design 
phase for each individual project, as needed.  
 
7.5 
Economic Environment  
The economic environment includes the capital costs associated with construction, professional fees and 
application fees.  Long-term costs associated with the operation and maintenance are also typically considered.  
Other project related costs, such as land acquisition and legal costs, are not usually included.  As part of the 
preliminary recommendations outlined herein, the relative construction costs, operation and maintenance costs, 
and cost-sharing opportunities should be considered.  
 
7.5.1 Maintenance Costs 
The Town of Saugeen Shores has a complex system for surface water drainage which includes overland sheet 
flow, natural water courses, municipal drains, tile drains, ditches, culverts and storm sewers.  Maintenance costs 
are considered to be negligible within the natural watercourses and for agricultural areas where drainage tiles 
are present (i.e. drainage tiles are installed on privately owned lands).  Municipal drains are also not considered 
to incur capital costs as drain inspection and clean-out, as necessary, should be completed under the Drainage 
Act, with costs apportioned to landowners as per the assessment schedule. 
 
Although the maintenance frequency may be variable, it is recommended that a maintenance schedule be 
established to ensure inspections and clean-outs are completed, as required to ensure the proper function of the 
system.  As the existing drainage and stormwater management infrastructure deteriorates and reaches the end 
of its service life, the maintenance costs typically increase.  With the implementation of the recommended

drainage improvements, it is expected that peak flows will be better conveyed, erosion and flooding potential will 
be reduced, and water quality will be improved.   Ultimately, as drainage improvements are achieved, the 
maintenance costs associated with these systems can be expected to decrease.   
 
7.5.2 Construction Costs 
Improvements to the existing system and additional stormwater management provisions required to manage the 
Town’s future drainage needs will have a capital cost associated with the planning, design and construction.  
Preliminary Class D cost estimates for various recommended solutions are provided herein.  The cost estimates 
generally include a 30% allowance for contingencies and engineering.  Land costs, legal costs, permit fees and 
costs for additional background studies (i.e. environmental impact study, geotechnical investigation, 
environmental assessment etc.) are not included in the construction cost estimates.    
 
Consideration should be given to implementing improvement options as part of future renewal projects to reduce 
costs.  For example, in areas where road reconstruction, watermains and/or sewer pipes are also needed, the 
works should be planned and constructed concurrently with the installation of the trunk storm sewer, where 
possible.  Further, project funding may be reviewed by the Town, as opportunities permit.  
 
It is noted that cost estimates provided herein were prepared with limited design details and are based on 
probable conditions affecting the project(s).  Therefore, they are intended to reflect the approximate magnitude 
of the project costs.  A more detailed assessment of overall project costs would be evaluated during the design 
development phases, as appropriate.  
 
 
8. 
ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS AND PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENTS  
8.1 
Planning Process: Master Plan  
The Municipal Class EA outlines a comprehensive planning process (illustrated in Figure 2-1) that provides a 
rational approach to consider the advantages and disadvantages of various alternatives and the trade-offs in 
order to determine a Preferred Solution, or set of Preferred Solutions, to address an identified problem (or 
opportunity), as well as consultation with the public, directly affected stakeholders, agencies and indigenous 
communities throughout the process.   
 
In the following Sections, drainage issues and future drainage needs are identified and the potential benefits and 
impacts of various stormwater drainage alternatives are generally assessed against social, natural, technical 
and economic factors (i.e. the ‘environments’).  Preliminary alternative solutions are then presented for each 
component catchment, as illustrated in the C-series of Drawings.  The ability of each alternative appropriately 
to address the defined problem and/or opportunity statement is also included in the assessment.  The 
assessment is based on existing environmental conditions compiled through field visits, site specific studies 
completed to date, and secondary source information.  It is noted that the alternatives presented in this Master 
Plan considered the cultural environment to be ‘net neutral’.  Additional archaeological and cultural heritage 
investigations may be required as part of the planning for individual projects (i.e. background studies).    
 
Upon consultation, comments received from the public, agencies and indigenous communities through the 
consultation process will be incorporated into the Master Plan, and the preliminary recommended solutions to 
each of the component catchments will be re-assessed.  This Master Plan is intended to provide sufficient 
documentation to fulfill the requirements of the first two Phases of the MCEA process.  It is presumed that the 
projects discussed herein will be classified as either Schedule A, A+, or B activities.  The intent of the Master

Plan is to satisfy the EA requirements for Schedule A/A+ projects, however, more detailed project-specific 
investigations will be required to fulfill the requirements for the identified Schedule B projects.  
 
The Master Drainage Plan for the Town has identified some Schedule B projects.  Schedule B projects primarily 
include improvements and minor expansions to existing facilities that have the potential for adverse 
environmental impacts.

SOUTHAMPTON: NORTH OF THE SAUGEEN RIVER 
9.1 
Background  
Drainage planning for the former Town of Southampton lands situated to the north of the Saugeen River was 
initially developed in 1996 and was presented in a report entitled “Master Drainage Plan, Special Policy Area 
No.2”.  The subject Master Drainage Plan included catchment area delineation, identification of drainage 
problems and recommended improvements, as well as identification of future drainage needs.  No significant 
changes in constructed areas have occurred since the 1996 report.  However, the Southampton Sanitary Sewer 
project, which was completed in 2010, may have opened up some lands for development.  Several planned 
development areas exist, including a majority of the inland areas located to the west of Tyendinaga Road.  
 
This section of the Master Drainage Plan may be considered a review and update of the 1996 report and its 
recommendations and includes refinements to the drainage mapping previously completed. Therefore, it is 
recommended that the 1996 report remain accessible as reference material.  As such, it is included in Appendix 
D of this Master Plan. 
 
9.2 
Drainage Area: Sub Catchments 
This section of the report focuses on the area within the former Town of Southampton located to the north of the 
Saugeen River, where shown on Figure 1-1.  This area is bounded on the south and east by the Saugeen River, 
by the Chippewas of Saugeen First Nation No.29 to the north and to the west by Lake Huron.  It is connected to 
the southerly portion of Southampton by the Zgaa-biig-ni-gan Bridge which crosses over the Saugeen River and 
connects North Rankin Street, situated within the subject drainage area, to Albert Street North.  As shown in 
Drawing A-2, this drainage area is divided into three sub catchment areas, identified as follows:

Existing Conditions and Typical Land Use 
9.3.1 Official Plan: Zoning 
This drainage area covers a total of approximately 276 hectares.  The soils in this area include a very thin layer 
of beach cobbles, sand, and gravel overlying hard clay and boulders/hardpan at shallow depth, resulting in a 
high water table.  The Soil Survey of Ontario identifies the surface soil in this area as Fox sandy loam and 
Sargent loam, with good natural drainage. 
 
With reference to Schedule A of the Town of Saugeen Shores Official Plan, a summary of the land use zoning 
within the former Town of Southampton to the north of the Saugeen River, is provided in Table 9-2.

Of the 276 hectares, approximately 67 hectares are road allowances or undevelopable shoreline.  In addition, 
as shown in Figure 9-1, a significant proportion of the area, estimated to be ±90 hectares (or about one-third), 
is designated as Significant Woodlands.  Significant woodlands are both important to the biological community 
and provide an important balance in the distribution of open space and passive recreation within an urban setting.  
According to Section 2.6.8.4 of the Official Plan, lands within a significant woodland area that are also designated 
as residential, may be developed in a way that protects and maintains the interior woodland features and values.   
 
With reference to Figure 9-1, the developed residential lands can be described as follows: 
1. The lands fronting on Tyendinaga Drive along the outer limits of the Golf Course 
2. A narrow development strip along Lake Huron, west of Turner Street and Bruce Road 
3. Lots fronting on Ottawa Avenue, Pottawatomie Drive, Mohawk Drive, and Copway Street 
4. Strip Development along North Rankin Street and the Saugeen River

The residential developed areas have not significantly increased since the Master Drainage Plan (1996) was 
completed for the Town.  As a general comparison, in 1996 the developed residential lands were estimated to 
encompass an area of ±72 hectares, whereas the developed residential lands are currently estimated to be ±80 
hectares.  Areas that saw development were primarily along Lake Huron, Bruce Road 13 and in the Copway 
Street area.  Industrial and commercial development is generally limited to areas along North Rankin Street, 
South Rankin Street, and the Saugeen River north-east of the bridge. 
 
9.3.2 Existing Infrastructure 
In addition to the culverts, ditches and natural water courses, approximately 12,000 meters of storm sewers exist 
in the area.  Of the existing infrastructure, it is estimated that approximately 90% of the storm sewers were 
constructed after the Master Drainage Plan was completed in 1996, as illustrated in the following Figure 9-2.

General Drainage Patterns and Catchments Areas 
Generally, stormwater flows from east to west, toward Lake Huron.  A distinct bluff runs along a north-south 
alignment approximately 800 meters east of the present day shoreline.  A small portion along the west and south 
side drains to the Saugeen River.  In the initial Master Drainage Plan (1996) for this area, it was determined that 
approximately 44 hectares drains to the Saugeen River, 1 hectare drains northerly across Craig Street to the 
Saugeen First Nation and the remaining 208 hectares drain to Lake Huron. 
 
Three primary sub catchments are defined for this area, where shown on Drawing A-2.  It is noted that the small 
areas along the Lake Huron shoreline and the Saugeen River that drain directly to those water bodies are 
considered minor catchments and are not delineated. 
 
In general, the sub catchments delineated in the area to the north of the Saugeen River are the same as those 
outlined in the Master Drainage Plan (1996).  However, some minor boundary adjustments have been made as 
part of this assessment to reflect noted field conditions.  The following Table 9-3 summarizes the characteristics 
of the sub catchments.  Reference should be made to Drawings B-1 through B-3 for more detailed information.

Previous Drainage Issues and Needs Identified  
The majority of the drainage issues identified in the initial Master Drainage Plan (1996) have since been 
addressed.  The outstanding recommendations from the Plan primarily include stormwater networks for future 
developments.   The Master Drainage Plan (1996) identified four recommendations for meeting future stormwater 
drainage needs in Southampton to the north of the Saugeen River, including the installation of four storm sewers 
to meet the needs of the planned subdivisions within the overall storm sewer network.  A summary of the 
locations and sizes of the storm sewers previously recommended is provided in Table 9-4.

Summary of Recommendations 
9.6.1 General Maintenance of Existing Infrastructure 
The primary issues identified in this drainage area include outlets blocked by debris along the Lake Huron 
shoreline and ponding of water on the golf course during spring runoff.  It is recommended that maintenance of 
the outlets continue on a routine (i.e. annual or bi-annual) or as-needed basis.  Recent high water levels 
experienced in 2017 through 2020 have resulted in increased maintenance needs at the outlets.  It is expected 
that water levels will continue to influence the maintenance frequency for the subject outlets.  
 
Field investigations noted three ditch inlet catchbasins at the west side of the golf course, as well as four inlets 
along the northwest portion and an additional four at the southwest portion of the golf course.  It is recommended 
that spring maintenance prior to the spring melt runoff be completed around the inlets to ensure that the inlets 
are clear.  
 
9.6.2 Future Needs 
The following Table 9-5 provides a summary of drainage recommendations for Southampton lands North of the 
Saugeen River.  The recommended solutions for each of the sub catchments are illustrated in Drawings C-1

SOUTHAMPTON: SOUTH OF THE RIVER 
10.1 Background 
Several stormwater management studies were previously completed for the area south of the Saugeen River 
within the former Town of Southampton, with the most recent being the ‘Town of Southampton Floodline Mapping 
Study’ (1991) and the ‘Town of Southampton Flood Control Study’ (1992).  Both were prepared for the Saugeen 
Valley Conservation Authority (SVCA) by the Lathem Group and are referred to herein as the Lathem Floodline 
Report (1991) and the Lathem Flood Control Study (1992).  The Lathem Reports specifically investigated areas 
of flooding and flood elevations, delineated catchments and identified channel spills.  
 
10.2 Drainage Area: Sub Catchments 
This section of the Master Drainage Plan focuses on the area to the south of the Saugeen River within the former 
Town of Southampton, where shown on Figure 1-1.  For the purposes of this Master Drainage Plan, the area 
extends from a northerly boundary at the Saugeen River, about Caroline Street, southerly to South Street.  The 
easterly boundary is the drainage divide near Links Sideroad and the boundary to the west is Lake Huron.  This 
drainage area covers approximately 1,212 hectares and, as shown in Drawing A-3, is divided into eleven sub 
catchment areas, identified as follows:

10.3 Existing Conditions and Typical Land Use 
10.3.1 Official Plan: Zoning 
This drainage area covers a total area of approximately 1,212 hectares.  With reference to Schedule A of the 
Town of Saugeen Shores Official Plan, a summary of the land use zoning within the former Town of Southampton 
to the south of the Saugeen River is provided in Table 10-2.  
 
The large agricultural areas are in the easterly portion of the subject drainage area, these account for 
approximately 38% of the total area.  Residential areas are concentrated along the shores of Lake Huron and to 
the west of Albert Street (i.e. Highway 21).  Commercial and industrial lands are predominately located along 
Albert Street and Railway Street and resource extraction areas are generally situated along Links Sideroad.

Schedule ‘A’ of the Official Plan delineates Special Policy Area #3 (SPA3) which is near Railway Street and Peel 
Street.  As outlined in Section 3.20.3 of the Official Plan, SPA3 exhibits environmental hazard features due to 
flooding and/or poor drainage concerns.  A copy of the relevant sections of the Official Plan, including Schedule 
A (i.e. the Land Use Map), is included in Appendix B.  With respect to SPA3, the Official Plan states that 
‘development may be permitted in accordance with the residential policies, provided a Stormwater Management 
Study is completed demonstrating that concerns regarding flood and fill and floodplain management can be dealt 
with through lot grading and stormwater facilities’.   
 
10.3.2 Physiography 
According to the Bruce County Soil Survey, Soil Survey of Ontario, 1983, the majority of the soils in this area 
have imperfect drainage and are classified as Brady sandy loam.  Areas with good and excessive drainage are 
typically found along the shore of Lake Huron (Plainfield Sand) and in the Links Sideroad area (Bridgeman Sand), 
which is identified as a beach area in the available ‘Physiography of Southern Ontario’ mapping.  The soils in 
the built-up urban areas and river and stream bottom are described as having ‘variable’ drainage.  Based on the 
information available, the soil drainage in the area, presented as a percent of the total area, is provided in Figure 
10-1.

10.3.3 Existing Infrastructure 
It is estimated that approximately 29,500 meters of storm sewers were installed in the area between 1972 and 
2018.  As illustrated in Figure 10-2, the majority of the storm sewers were installed after the Lathem Reports 
were completed in the early 1990’s.  In addition, ditches and culverts facilitate drainage from large portions of 
this area, including the rural/agricultural areas to the east, along Railway Street, and many in proximity to the 
Lake Huron shore and Fairy Lake.  
 
 
FIGURE 10-2: Length of Storm Main Installation by Year - Southampton South 
 
10.4 General Drainage Patterns and Catchment Areas 
Generally, stormwater in the 1,212-hectare drainage area flows from east to west and drains into either the 
Saugeen River or Lake Huron.  Most of the area is gently sloping, with steeper slopes close to Lake Huron.  The 
major drainage sub catchments are described in Table 10-3 and are outlined in Drawing A-3.  Small areas along 
Lake Huron and the Saugeen River, which drain directly to those water bodies, are considered minor catchments 
and are not delineated. 
 
Of the eleven catchments in this area, the four largest catchments drain the agricultural areas situated to the 
east through urban/settlement area, with outlets either to the Saugeen River or to Lake Huron.  With the 
exception of Outlet 5, the remainder of the sub catchments are entirely urban (i.e. within the settlement area).  
Seven catchments, representing 678 hectares, outlet at Lake Huron, while four outlets, representing 474 
hectares, drain to the Saugeen River. 
 
The following Table 10-3 summarizes the characteristics of the sub catchments.  Outlet numbers generally 
increase from north to south across Southampton (south of the Saugeen River).  As outlined in Table 10-1, 
reference should be made to Drawings B-4 through B-14 for more detailed information.

10.4.1 Outlet No.4: Louisa Street 
This long and narrow catchment area drains the northernmost part of the subject drainage area, including 
drainage from Caroline Street south to Alfred Street.  As shown on Drawing B-4, the drainage area extends 
westerly beyond Carlisle Street and includes a large portion of the Southampton Airport.  The majority of the 
catchment is zoned agricultural, with residential development within the westerly downstream portion.  The 
catchment area encompasses the Southampton Airport and the Caroline Street Flour Mill. 
 
Storm sewers were constructed along Edward Street and Augusta Street, with the remainder of the catchment 
draining via ditches and culverts.  The watercourses north of Louisa Street and between Louisa Street and 
Augusta Street merge near the catchment outlet. 
 
DRAINAGE ISSUES IDENTIFIED 
 Stormwater drainage from the Caroline Street Flour Mill area is believed to flow westerly and southerly 
through unopened road allowances.  Surface water ponding is occurring in an area bound by Caroline 
Street (unopened road allowance), Anglesia Street, Louisa Street and Carlisle Street.   
 The runoff from the northerly side of Louisa Street should be kept separate from the runoff from the 
southerly side, as the southerly side drains via a natural watercourse, which crosses residential lots. 
 Erosion has been noted at the outlet to the Saugeen River. 
 
FUTURE DRAINAGE NEEDS 
Based on the information available, there are no current planned developments within this catchment.  However, 
as shown in Drawing C-4, there are three blocks of undeveloped land zoned as ‘residential-holding’ within the 
Official Plan boundaries which may be developed in the longer-term horizon.  Two of the residential holding 
blocks are upstream of the current residential areas and associated storm sewer systems.  One residential 
holding block is situated between Anglesia and Edward Street, north of the Alfred Street right-of-way (ROW).  
This area is surrounded by previously developed residential properties and is connected to the residential holding 
block identified within Outlet 5.  The stormwater management plan for planned development within this block 
should consider split drainage.

RECOMMENDATIONS 
1. Priority: High 
The primary drainage issue within the Louisa Street sub catchment is in the area bound by Caroline Street, 
Anglesia Street, Louisa Street, and Carlisle Street.  To alleviate surface ponding in this area, a new ditch 
along the Caroline Street road allowance to the west side of Anglesia Street, as well as ditch improvements 
along Anglesia Street and Louisa Street, is recommended (refer to Drawing C-4).  This work could be 
completed under a capital project.  
2. Priority: Medium 
Erosion at the Louisa Street outlet to the Saugeen River should be rectified with large diameter riprap over 
filter cloth.  This work could be completed as maintenance.  Based on field investigations completed March 
2020, erosion here is not very significant.  
3. Future Development: 
Future development should be required to maintain post-development peak flow rates to pre-development 
peak flow rates, if possible, to prevent downstream erosion. 
 
10.4.2 Outlet No.5: Alice Street 
This relatively small catchment includes lands between Alfred Street and Alice Street, draining flows westward 
from Carlisle Street to an outlet to the Saugeen River situated north of Alice Street.  As shown on Drawing B-5, 
the major flow route in this catchment is an intermittent watercourse.  
 
DRAINAGE ISSUES IDENTIFIED 
In discussion with the Town in April 2019, the intersection of Alice Street and Anglesia Street was identified as 
an area with frequent flooding and standing water.  This intersection is on the southerly boundary of the Alice 
Street catchment and, under significant storms, water may spill over into the catchment to the south (i.e. Outlet 
No.6: Fairy Lake Creek).  This area was identified as ‘Flood Damage Center G1’ in the Lathem Flood Control 
Study (1992).  The Flood Control Study found that the 450mmØ culvert crossing Anglesia Street is undersized 
for the 1:5 year design storm.  The 600mmØ culvert at Edward Street is expected to be able to convey a 5-year 
storm.  
 
The natural watercourse is located to the north of Alice Street.  Between Anglesia Street and Edward Street the 
watercourse runs across private property which, in some cases, gets closer than 10 meters to buildings.  Based 
on the SVCA mapping, this watercourse is considered to be intermittent.  On the aerial photography, the 
watercourse appears to be shallow and grassed in the summer.  A field review completed in March 2020 noted 
several private crossings which have the potential to obstruct the flow in the watercourse. 
 
FUTURE DRAINAGE NEEDS 
Based on the Official Plan, there are no current planned developments.  However, as shown in Drawing C-5, 
there are two blocks of undeveloped land zoned as ‘residential-holding’ which may be developed in the future.  
Both are situated between Alfred Street and Alice Street.  One is located in the downstream portion of the 
catchment, west of Edward Street, and the other is to the east of Edward Street, adjacent to the most westerly 
residential holding block identified in Outlet 4.  Drainage from these undeveloped blocks could be managed as 
follows:  
i. Drainage from the residential-holding area could outlet to the existing watercourse.  Preventing erosion 
of the watercourse downstream would be the main concern.  It may be worth considering a direct 
outlet to the watercourse so that the peak flow from the development could pass before the 
watercourse peak flow, which would reduce the overall peak flow in the watercourse; and/or

MASTER DRAINAGE PLAN 
GMBP FILE: 219020 
DECEMBER 2020 (DRAFT FOR REVIEW) 
 
 
PAGE 33 OF 73 
ii. Drainage from the residential-holding block south of Alfred Street and east of Edward Street should be 
directed along the southerly right-of-way to the Edward Street culvert, where shown on Drawing C-5.  
It is recommended to limit post-development flows to pre-development levels, if possible. 
 
Stormwater management for both areas would be completed as part of future development and no capital 
projects are expected to be required to meet the stormwater management needs of these lands. 
 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
1. Priority: Medium 
The Lathem Report (1991) notes that the 450mmØ culvert crossing Anglesia Street is undersized for the 
1:5 year design storm.  It is recommended that 600mmØ culvert be installed at this location to convey the 
1:5 year design storm, where shown on Drawing C-5.  
2. Priority: Low 
Replacement of the 600mmØ culvert at Edward Street with a similar size, when necessary (subject to 
inspection findings). 
3. SVCA Consultation 
The Saugeen Valley Conservation Authority should follow up to ensure any built facilities within the 
regulated area were constructed as permitted and the watercourse is not obstructed.  
4. Future Development: 
Future development should be required to maintain post-development peak flow rates to pre-development 
peak flow rates, if possible, to prevent downstream erosion. 
 
10.4.3 Outlet No.6: Fairy Lake Creek 
This relatively large catchment drains an area of about 344 hectares, from Alice Street to Spence Street, east to 
Concession 14 and Links Sideroad intersection, and west of Fairy Lake to Victoria Street.  The catchment area 
is outlined on Drawing B-6.  Most of the area is zoned agricultural with residential lands occupying the westerly 
portion of the catchment.  Areas have been designated in the Official Plan as Hazard/Environmental Protection 
along natural waterways and ditches.  Institutional uses in proximity to Fairy Lake include Bruce County Museum 
and Cultural Center and Grey Bruce Health Services.  
 
Storm sewers have been constructed in the residential areas, whereas the agricultural areas are drained by 
ditches and culverts.  In addition, two natural watercourses were identified in this catchment, including the 
following:   
i. The northerly watercourse has three branches east of Anglesia Street between Alice Street and High 
Street and merges to one at the Anglesia Street crossing just south of Clarendon Street.  The 
watercourse drains to Lakeland Drive where it confluences with Fairy Lake Creek, then subsequently 
outlets to the Saugeen River.   
ii. The southerly watercourse originates east of Carlisle Street and drains along the unopened Morpeth 
Street road allowance to Grenville Street, then continues along the unopened Palmerston Street road 
allowance and then northward along Scott Lane and Breadalbane Street into Fairy Lake. 
 
The main overland flow routes generally follow the existing water courses.  An additional overland flow route is 
along High Street from Anglesia Street to Fairy Lake. 
 
The Spence Street and Grenville Street intersection is on the southerly boundary of this catchment.  Flow drains 
in a swale westerly along Spence Street.  At this intersection, flow on the north side of Spence Street is directed 
northerly along Grenville Street, initially via a 525mmØ storm sewer.  The storm sewer increases in size to 
1200mmØ as it drains north to High Street then continues west and outlets to Fairy Lake.

A 750mmØ culvert crosses Spence Street on the east leg of the Grenville Street intersection.  It is likely that this 
culvert would facilitate spills southerly across Spence Street and along Grenville Street during small to medium 
sized storms.  However, larger storms are likely to spill over Grenville Street and continue westward along 
Spence Street.  Therefore, Spence Street acts as a drainage divide.  A 450mmØ culvert crossing the north leg 
of the intersection is shown in the Town’s GIS database.  However, based on a survey completed by GMBP in 
2018 it does not actually exist.  This culvert may have been removed when the Grenville storm sewer was built 
northerly.  A Stormwater Management Report for the Spence Street development block is currently being 
prepared, which will review high flow spill conditions along Spence Street.  A Stormwater Management Report 
for the development block east of Grenville also is being prepared.   
 
DRAINAGE ISSUES IDENTIFIED 
Fairy Lake reportedly was designed and built as a Stormwater Management Pond with a controlled outlet.  
Reportedly it does not have additional capacity to manage any increase in peak runoff from new development.  
Design records and approvals have not been located as of this writing.  Therefore, development upstream of 
Fairy Lake must provide stormwater management facilities, suitably to mitigate any increase in peak flow due to 
development.  
 
Frequent standing water has been noted to occur in an area to the south of Fairy Lake, generally bound by Grey 
Street, Breadalbane Street, Palmerston Street, Victoria Street, and Scott Lane (i.e. Jubilee Park).  The southerly 
natural watercourse drains through this area and outlets to Fairy Lake along Scott Lane and Breadalbane Street. 
The majority of this area is regulated by the SVCA and, as such, any flow blockages should be investigated by 
the Conservation Authority.  Any development in this area should include an improved outlet to Fairy Lake.  It is 
noted that during large storm events, the water may spill over Breadalbane Street into the Morpeth Street 
catchment (i.e. Outlet No.10).  
  
The Alice Street and Anglesia Street intersection was identified by Town staff as an area with frequent standing 
water and drains to the Alice Street catchment (i.e. Outlet No.5).  During large storm events, stormwater may 
spill over Alice Street into this adjacent catchment.  The flows would be directed in a southerly direction into the 
watercourse south of Clarendon Street. 
 
FUTURE DRAINAGE NEEDS 
Development is planned to the east of the existing residential development, between Grenville Street and 
Anglesia Street and within the blocks directly to the north and south of High Street, where shown in Drawing C-
6.  This area currently drains into the southerly watercourse that originates at Carlisle Street and flows into Fairy 
Lake.  Stormwater management for these areas would be completed as part of a Plan of Subdivision and no 
capital projects are expected to be required to meet the stormwater management needs of these lands. 
 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
Priority: Low 
Erosion control measures at outlet to Fairy Lake - In consideration of the noted area of poor drainage situated to 
the south of Fairy Lake, in the vicinity of Jubilee Park, future development plans that could impact flows to the 
southerly watercourse should consider an improved outlet to Fairy Lake as a requirement for any development 
plan for those lands.  
 
Priority: Low 
The Town should endeavour to locate the design records and approvals for the Fairy Lake SWM facility.  These 
records may help to evaluate the current performance of the system versus the design expectations.  Further, 
the approval may contain monitoring, maintenance and/or performance requirements, which should be 
addressed.  Alternatively, a SWM review of the existing system could be completed to update design criteria and 
verify available capacity within this system.

10.4.7 Outlet No.10: Morpeth Street 
This catchment covers an area of approximately 27 hectares. The catchment is irregularly shaped, generally 
extending along the length of Morpeth Street from Grenville Street westerly to Lake Huron.  The majority of this 
catchment is zoned residential, with the exception of a commercial area near Albert Street and some 
environmental protection lands. 
 
A natural watercourse flows from approximately Grey Street to the north, then is directed west into the catchment 
at Breadalbane Street, flowing centrally through the block located north of Morpeth Street to Albert Street.  The 
watercourse between Victoria Street and Albert Street is within a SVCA regulated area.  At Albert Street the flow 
is conveyed in a 900mmØ storm sewer westerly to Lake Huron, where the drainage outlets via a culvert onto the 
shores of Lake Huron, where shown on Drawing B-10. 
 
DRAINAGE ISSUES IDENTIFIED 
 The area around Victoria Street and Morpeth Street was identified by Town staff as an area with 
drainage issues.  In that area, it appears that the discharge from a 525mmØ storm sewer, that drains the 
upper reaches of this catchment, outlets to the above referenced natural watercourse.   
 The outlet under Victoria Street flows through private lands and the channel becomes poorly defined 
after it crosses Knechtel Lane.     
 During large storms, water may spill into this catchment from the Fairy Lake Creek (i.e. Outlet No.6) 
catchment near Breadalbane Street South, flowing into the Morpeth Street and Victoria Street area. 
 Flows from the natural watercourse enter a 900mmØ storm sewer at Albert Street and subsequently 
discharge to Lake Huron.  High water levels and debris blocking the outlet has been noted. 
 
FUTURE DRAINAGE NEEDS 
None identified. 
 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
1. Priority: Medium 
Culvert Maintenance: Maintenance and culvert cleanouts at Knechtel Lane and at Victoria Street.   
Culvert Replacement: At the end of their service lives, the 1,000mmØ and 900mmØ culverts should be re-
designed to verify appropriate sizing. 
2. SVCA Consultation 
The Saugeen Valley Conservation Authority should follow up to ensure any built facilities within the 
regulated area were constructed as permitted and the watercourse is not obstructed.  
3. General Maintenance: 
Complete annual, semi-annual or as-needed maintenance of the outlet to Lake Huron. 
 
10.4.8 Outlet No.11: Adelaide Street 
This is a very small urban catchment, covering an area of approximately 2 hectares.  This catchment is entirely 
residential.  As shown in Drawing B-11, the catchment has a rectangular shape and extends from Lake Street 
west to Lambert Lane between Peel Street and Adelaide Street. A single storm sewer extends along Lambert 
Lane, which directs flows to Adelaide Street.  Drainage is then directed to the west to an infiltration basin that is 
located at the end of Adelaide Street.  An overflow outlets to Lake Huron situated at the top of the beach.  
Overflows spill out of the top of the catchbasin and flow overland.

10.4.9 Outlet No.12: Island Street 
This is a large urban catchment at 71 hectares in area.  It is primarily residential, with some commercial and 
industrial zoned properties along Albert Street and Railway Street.  There is some open space zoning along 
Island Street which is the Southampton Tourist Camp.  The water treatment plant is located within the southern 
portion of this catchment.  
 
As shown on Drawing B-12, the catchment is an irregularly shaped rectangle that extends west from Grenville 
Street to Lake Street, between Spence Street in the north and Island Street in the south.  The majority of the 
area drains within storm sewers and outlets to an open outfall located within the Southampton Chantry Dunes 
Beach Area via a 900mmØ storm sewer and ultimately flows further west to Lake Huron.  However, the area 
along Railway Street appears to drain to the north via ditches and culverts.  In addition, Breadalbane Street 
appears to drain via ditches and culverts and the Victoria Street area appears to drain by overland flow.  There 
are no natural waterways in this catchment, however, the channel that the outlet drains to is considered 
ecologically sensitive and to provide fish habitat.  The SVCA has classified this channel as a watercourse.   
 
Based on the available information, the Island Street storm sewer outfall bi-sects the Southampton Chantry 
Dunes beach ecological system, which is located between the Bay Street and Beach Street Road allowances.  
The original natural outlet to this catchment area previously would have been the Bay Street Outlet (i.e. Outlet 
No.13).  
 
DRAINAGE ISSUES IDENTIFIED 
The need for improvements to the Island Street storm sewer system outlet was recently identified by the Town.  
Based on the Town’s experience, the Island Street storm sewer and outfall displays conveyance capacity issues 
for less than the 5-year storm.  Further, based on information provided in the Island Street Storm Sewer Study, 
which was initiated to investigate outlet upgrades (R.J. Burnside & Associates Engineering, 2017/2018), several 
issues have been noted, as follows:   
 The presence of stagnant water within the existing storm sewer network, and 
 Erosion and displacement of the outfall during major storm events 
 
Reportedly the catchment area for the Island Street outlet is significantly greater than the initial 38.5-hectares 
incorporated into the 1991 design.  Further, the system was designed to convey peak flows up to and including 
the 2-year event.  This is undersized when compared to current standards which typically account for the 5-year 
return frequency design storm.  Therefore, due to the expansion of the catchment area footprint, coupled with 
the increase in impervious areas and changed design standards, the storm sewer system within this catchment 
is undersized.  To address these drainage issues, the Island Street Storm Sewer Study proposed that the storm 
sewer outfall be designed to a 5-year event and the sizing of the outlet pipe be designed to accommodate the 
10 and 25-year design flows for the 71-hectare catchment.

PAGE 38 OF 73 
The Study also identified that, since the Island Street stormwater outlet conveys stormwater from the streets of 
Southampton through the Chantry Dunes to Lake Huron, any future design should have consideration for the 
aquatic and terrestrial vegetation and wildlife within this system which are sensitive to disturbance.  Accordingly, 
the stormwater quality control measures would need to be designed to provide Enhanced Level treatment.  
Completing upgrades to either outlet would require careful timing and significant protection measures.  This could 
make upgrades cost prohibitive. 
 
One possible solution is to connect the storm sewer system to the Bay Street storm sewer system (i.e. Outlet 
No.13), while ensuring both systems are able to adequately convey the 1:5 year storm event.  The natural outlet 
at Bay Street (i.e. Outlet No.13) would likely also be considered to be sensitive to disturbance.   
 
FUTURE DRAINAGE NEEDS 
This area is considered to be almost fully developed.  As shown in Drawing C-12, there are some potential 
development areas between Breadalbane Street South and Grey Street, and near Railway Street. 
 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
Priority: High 
The Island Street Storm Sewer outfall is a critical component of the upstream sewer network.  As such, Burnside 
has proposed that the outfall be designed to a 5-year event and the outlet pipe be sized to accommodate 10 and 
25-year design flows.  Several background studies and approvals would be required, and significant consultation 
is expected.  To date, several of the required background studies have been completed, however, the EA process 
has not been initiated.       
 
Priority: High 
Connect to Bay Street Outlet (i.e. Outlet No.13) at Island Street and Huron Street and ensure both catchments 
are able to convey the 1:5 year storm event.  Storm sewers within the Bay Street catchment will likely need 
improvements, as discussed in the section below.  As such, this would need to be done concurrently or after the 
Bay Street outlet/Huron connection.  This forms part of the recommendations for the Bay Street catchment.  As 
suggested in the Burnside report, the design of the storm sewers should provide free flowing conditions, where 
possible, and explore opportunities for exfiltration out of the storm sewer network through perforated pipes, linear 
soak away pits or infiltration trenches.   
 
10.4.10 Outlet No.13: Bay Street 
This is a large catchment area, approximately 229 hectares in size.  As shown in Drawing B-13, the catchment 
extends from the Concession 14 and Links Sideroad area, passing to the south of Spence Street towards Bay 
Street.  Flows subsequently drain to an outlet at Lake Huron.  This catchment includes a mix of residential, 
commercial, industrial, open space, and agricultural land uses. 
 
A significant natural watercourse with constant flows arises east of Carlisle Street and flows in a westerly 
direction.  Two additional intermittent streams arise south of Peel Street and converge with the main watercourse 
at a location just south of McNabb Street.  A division of these flows, with some directed into the Huron Street 
catchment to the south (i.e. Outlet No.14), may occur during large storm events.  The natural watercourse 
continues in a westerly direction towards Huron Street.  It crosses a mobile home park and travels along Third 
Street and outlets to Lake Huron via a 1200mmØ culvert that runs through private property.  Additional flows to 
this outlet include stormwater from the Huron Street storm sewers which discharge to the ditches that extend 
along the south side of Bay Street, and outlet via a 1500mmØ culvert.

PAGE 39 OF 73 
DRAINAGE ISSUES IDENTIFIED 
 The outlet of the natural watercourse is situated immediately north of Bay Street, across from Third Street.  
The watercourse outlets across private property via a 1200mmØ culvert.  To ensure maintenance and 
reduce access issues, it is preferred that stormwater conveyance structures be located in a right-of-way 
or drainage easement.  Further, this culvert is within the SVCA Regulated Area and would be required to 
be maintained in accordance with SVCA regulations.  
 Stormwater from Huron Street is conveyed along Bay Street to the outlet via a 1500mmØ culvert.  
Connecting the Huron Street storm sewers to the Island Street storm sewers, as well as upgrading some 
storm sewers along Huron Street, may provide sufficient capacity to allow both systems to convey the 5-
year storm.  
 Flooding during storms has been noted along Bay Street from McNabb Street to Albert Street South. Storm 
sewer construction in the area is planned in the Town’s 5-year plan.  
 Frequent standing water in the rear yards along Archibald Place and Cedar Brush Drive has been noted. 
The watercourse in this area is regulated by the SVCA.  Maintenance of the watercourse and removing 
any obstructions to the watercourse is recommended to be completed under SVCA jurisdiction. 
 
FUTURE DRAINAGE NEEDS 
This area is considered to be almost fully developed.  Development is planned north of Bay Street between 
Huron Street and Albert Street.  The natural watercourse crosses this planned development area.  The area east 
of Railway Street and McNabb Street (Southampton Landing) is currently zoned Residential Holding.  In addition, 
drainage from along Island Street and Painted Post Lane is conveyed along the unopened Grosvenor Street 
South road allowance. 
 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
1. Priority: High 
To reduce reliance on the 1200mmØ culvert on private property, and to assist with the drainage issues in 
the Island Street catchment, the storm sewers along Huron Street South and Bay Street to the outlet should 
be improved.  Creative solutions to increasing the capacity of the outlet with low impact on the Chantry 
Dunes system may be required.  Based on a preliminary review, it is recommended that a larger storm sewer 
be designed and installed along Huron Street between Island Street and Bay Street to handle overflows from 
the Island Street catchment (No.12), up to the 5-year storm.  This is illustrated on Drawing C-13. 
2. Priority: High 
Continue with the planned storm sewer construction along Bay Street between McNabb Street and Albert 
Street South.  
3. General Maintenance: 
Maintenance of the watercourse and removing any obstructions to the watercourse between Railway Street 
and Albert Street South is recommended to be completed under SVCA jurisdiction. 
 
10.4.11 Outlet No.14: Huron Street South 
This catchment is approximately 320 hectares in area.  The catchment is a mix of residential, industrial, 
agricultural, resource extraction, hazard land and open space.  Its boundary extends from Links Sideroad to the 
west to Lake Huron and includes the area around Bruce Road 3/South Street extending to the north towards 
Peel Street.

Two intermittent watercourses convey flows to Railway Street where they become permanent, converging to the 
west of McNabb Street.  The watercourse continues between Cole Boulevard and Summerhill Road, where 
shown on Drawing B-14.  Two outlets exist.  The northerly crossing of Huron Street appears to be the major 
natural watercourse outlet with a 1,650 x 1,120mmØ corrugated steel pipe arch (or CSPA) crossing at Huron 
Street (Gamsby and Mannerow Project No. M-1521, March 2004).  The southerly crossing, which is considered 
a secondary outlet, is comprised of a 1800mmØ culvert and provides local drainage on Huron Street. 
 
DRAINAGE ISSUES IDENTIFIED 
Agricultural Areas: Tile Drains 
Upstream agricultural areas include some areas with tile drains.  Tile drains are not designed to limit peak flow 
to pre-implementation levels and may increase peak flow rates in the downstream watercourse.  Increased 
flooding and standing water east of Railway Street near South Street is believed to be partially caused by the 
upstream constructed tile drains.  The general requirements for agricultural tile drains are provided in Section 
5.5 of this Master Drainage Plan. 
 
Natural Watercourse: Culvert Condition and Sizing 
An identified watercourse exists just south of Kuhl Electric and another watercourse travels through Special 
Policy Area #3, north of Kuhl Electric.  It is the responsibility of landowners to allow the watercourse to flow.  A 
review of culvert sizes in the GIS database for this area shows that the southernmost watercourse has a 
750mmØ crossing and a 900mmØ crossing exists further to the north.  The 750mmØ culvert under Railway 
Street is approximately 20 years past its expected service life.  Larger culvert diameters may be required for the 
most southern watercourse crossing Railway Street and Creekwood Drive, as it appears to now be the main 
crossing.  
 
Standing Water 
Frequent standing water has been noted along McNabb Street from Cole Boulevard north to the watercourse. 
The road has little slope in this area and there are no ditches along the road.  Storm sewers along the west side 
of the road provide drainage north to the watercourse.  The storm system is connected to the storm sewer outlet 
north of the culverts, which may be flowing full for long periods of time as it outlets from a stormwater 
management pond east of McNabb Street.  Options for improvement include (i) improving the swale on the east 
side of the road and (ii) improving the storm sewer system drainage by constructing a new outlet to the 
watercourse. 
 
FUTURE DRAINAGE NEEDS 
The portion of this area within the Town of Southampton settlement area boundary appears to be generally well 
developed.  There is a small area of planned development southwest of the Huron Street and Bay Street 
intersection, as well as single lot development areas within the residential area. 
 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
1. Priority: High 
Swale and outlet construction along McNabb Street: Swale improvements along McNabb Street from 
Lakeside Drive north to the watercourse, and the construction of a new separate outlet from the storm sewer 
system to the watercourse are recommended.  
2. Priority: Medium 
Culvert improvements/upgrades at Railway Street north of South Street and at Creekwood Drive.  
3. Rural Tile Drains: 
Rural tile drains that outlet to roadside ditches are to be approved by the Town of Saugeen Shores.  Tile 
drain approval may require limiting peak flows.

10.5.2 General Maintenance of Existing Infrastructure 
A relatively consistent issue identified in this drainage area is that outlets become blocked by debris along the 
Lake Huron shoreline.  Therefore, it is recommended that maintenance of the outlets occur on a routine (i.e. 
annual or bi-annual) or as-needed basis.  Recent high water levels experienced between 2017 and 2020 have 
resulted in increased maintenance needs at the outlets.  It is expected that water levels will continue to influence 
the maintenance frequency for the subject outlets.  
 
In addition, some of the watercourses drain through residential areas and are within SVCA regulated areas.  It 
is recommended that the SVCA ensure the buildings or other installations were constructed, as permitted, and 
the watercourses are not obstructed.  Catchments include: 
Outlet 5: Alice Street between Alice and Anglesia Street 
Outlet 10: Morpeth Street between Victoria Street and Albert Street 
Outlet 13: Bay Street, east of Albert Street South 
 
Further, the Town should maintain all design records and approvals for the Stormwater Management Facilities.  
More specifically, the records for the Fairy Lake SWM facility would help to evaluate the current performance of 
the system.  Alternatively, a SWM review of the existing system for Fairy Lake could be completed to update 
design criteria and verify available capacity within this system.

This section of the Master Plan focuses on the area within the former Town of Port Elgin, where shown on Figure 
1-1.  For the purposes of this Master Plan, this area extends from lands just north of Concession 10 southerly to 
Concession 4 and from the Official Plan settlement area boundary for Port Elgin west to the shores of Lake 
Huron.  This drainage area covers an area of approximately 2,078 hectares.  As shown in Drawing A-4, this 
drainage area is divided into fourteen (14) sub catchment areas.  The drainage outlets and the relevant drainage 
studies, where applicable, are listed in Table 11-1.

Development in Port Elgin has historically been centered along Goderich Street, along the westerly Lake Huron 
shoreline, and along the main east-west connecting streets such as Market Street.  From these central areas, 
development has progressed outwards to the north, south and east.  The main commercial and industrial areas 
are along Goderich Street and Concession 10.  
 
The Environmental Protection and Hazard zoning covers about 18% of the land within this study area.  This 
includes large sections of land north of Concession 10, south of Bruce Road 25, along the shore of Lake Huron 
and along Mill Creek. 
 
11.3.2 Physiography 
Soil drainage in this area varies widely.   Areas with excessive drainage are found near the shore of Lake Huron, 
which is identified as Plainfield sand or Eastport sand gravel, and along the eastern edge of this study area, 
which is identified as Bridgeman sand and characterized as sand beaches.  Areas with good drainage are found 
east and south of the main urban area, where the soils are identified as Fox sandy loam. 
 
Areas with imperfect drainage are found north and south of the main urban area in an area commonly identified 
as tablelands which has a shallow slope to the west.  The tablelands soils are identified as Brady sandy loam, 
Berrien sandy loam, and Elderslie silt loam.  Areas with poor drainage are found near Macgregor Point and near 
Concession 10 east of Cutter Drive and are generally identified as depression muck.

11.3.3 Existing Infrastructure 
It is estimated that approximately 51,350 meters of storm sewers were installed in the area between 1960 and 
2018.  As illustrated in Figure 11-2, a significant proportion of the storm sewers have been installed between 
2004 and present.  In addition, ditches and culverts facilitate drainage in some areas.  Much of the Port Elgin 
storm capacity has traditionally been infiltration galleries.  Since amalgamation the town has progressively been 
working towards creating proper outlets and trunk storm sewers to convey stormwater to the Lake.   
 
 
FIGURE 11-2: Length of Storm Main Installation by Year – Port Elgin 
 
 
11.4 General Drainage Patterns and Catchment Areas 
In general, stormwater in the 2,078-hectare drainage area flows westerly to Lake Huron.  A small portion drains 
easterly to Mill Creek, which is a tributary to the Saugeen River.  Flows that drain directly to Mill Creek are 
identified as the Mill Creek Urban Area catchment (i.e. Outlet No.27).  Prior to development, the tablelands area 
drained by sheet flow, which collected into watercourses near the bluffs and then drained through the lower lands 
to Lake Huron.  In the existing post-development condition, most of this area is serviced by a network of storm 
sewers.  Several stormwater management ponds have been constructed on or below the bluffs to control the 
peak flows that outlet to the various watercourses which drain to Lake Huron. 
 
The following Table 11-3 summarizes the characteristics of the sub catchments.  As shown in Drawing A-4, 
outlet numbers generally increase from north to south across Port Elgin.  As outlined in Table 11-1, reference 
should be made to Drawings B-15 through B-28 and C-15 through C-28 for more detailed information.  Small 
areas drain directly to Lake Huron and are, as such, considered minor catchments and are not delineated.

11.4.1 Outlet No.15: Collard Way 
This small catchment drains via a storm sewer within the neighbourhood that it encompasses, where shown in 
Drawing B-15.  Flow from upstream agricultural lands drains via sheet flow to the bluff, where an eroded ravine 
feature conveys flow down the bluff to the west, along a natural watercourse situated to the north of the Collard 
Way subdivision.  Berms to the east of the subdivision, in the general area of local trails, were constructed to 
direct flows northward to the natural watercourse.

11.4.2 Outlet No.16: Miramichi Bay 
As shown in Drawing B-16, the Miramichi Bay catchment extends along the north side of Concession Road 10 
from Highway 21 towards Miramichi Bay Road.  In general, it drains agricultural lands above the bluff westerly 
to Lake Huron.  West of the bluff an intermittent watercourse arises, this converges with the permanent 
watercourse that drains in a westerly direction from Pegasus Trails subdivision, ultimately flowing into Lake 
Huron.  
 
A spring that rises south of Concession 10 below the bluff is identified as Stream No.1 in the Summerside 
subdivision plan and drains northerly across Concession 10.  It joins the intermittent watercourse east of 
Lakeside Woods Crescent.  Stream No.1 experiences seasonally high flows, which were designed to spill into 
the Concession 10 trunk storm sewer outlet to protect the downstream Miramichi Bay subdivision.

RECOMMENDATIONS 
A Lakeside Woods subdivision is located to the 
southwest of this outlet.  At this time, the majority 
of this area, pre-development, drains to a ditch 
and culvert situated to the south and east of the 
Miramichi Bay outlet.  A small portion drains to 
the intermittent watercourse.  The Lakeside 
Woods subdivision, as designed (i.e. post-
construction), should manage any increase in 
peak flows into the outlet into which it drains. 
High water levels in Lake Huron are having an 
impact, plugging many culverts in this area.

11.4.3 Outlet No.17: Concession 10 
The drainage system for the Concession 10 catchment was planned under a Schedule B Municipal Class 
Environmental Assessment process (GMBP File No. M-1536).  As shown in Drawing B-17, the Concession 10 
catchment area includes a trunk storm sewer system and a stormwater management pond to mitigate peak flows 
associated with the development of the Town’s industrial park and outfall to Lake Huron.  Lands to the northeast 
of Concession 10 and Highway 21, which also contribute to the trunk storm sewer outfall, include the Camp 
Kenorus campground and lands east of the rail trail, which drain via storm sewer along the east side of Goderich 
Street and outlet to a ditch along the north side of Concession 10, eventually entering the Concession 10 trunk 
storm sewer outlet.  Drainage of lands to the southeast of the Goderich Street and Concession 10 intersection 
is directed to a 1650mmØ storm sewer that crosses Goderich Street immediately north of Tomlinson Drive.   
 
As discussed in the previous Section (i.e. Outlet No.16), Stream No.1 which flows from below bluff through the 
Summerside subdivision then north across Concession 10, experiences seasonally high flows, which were 
designed to spill into the Concession 10 trunk storm sewer outlet to protect the downstream Miramichi Bay 
subdivision.   
 
Further, the design of the trunk storm sewer outfall included an allowance for future development of residential 
lands.  More specifically, the trunk storm sewer along Concession 10 has been designed with capacity to provide 
drainage for a portion of the Summerside subdivision, which is located to the southwest of the intersection of 
Concession 10 and Goderich Street.  The trunk storm sewer was sized using Douglas Point rainfall data.  As 
previously discussed, the Town currently requires the use of the Goderich IDF curves to model rainfall events 
which generally yield greater design flows than the previously used Douglas Point IDF data.

DRAINAGE ISSUES 
Cutter Road: Cutter Road is in the west end of the catchment, approximately 150 meters east of the Lake Huron 
shoreline, and drains via ditches and culverts.  Cutter Road has a very flat grade and may have a reverse slope 
in some areas.  While some drainage may be able to be directed to the south to Stream No.2 (refer to Outlet 
No.18), the construction of storm sewers connected to the trunk storm sewer along Concession 10 could also 
be considered.  It is recommended that a review of available capacity be completed at the time of subdivision 
design.  Further, future designs would need to recognize that this capacity has been claimed. 
 
Area North of Concession 10: According to the Town, some drainage concerns in the area to the north of 
Concession Road 10 and west of Goderich Street have been expressed.  Drainage in this area is expected to 
be by overland sheet flow to ditches and/or the natural watercourse identified as Stream No.1 and is ultimately 
conveyed into the storm trunk sewer discharging to Lake Huron via the Concession 10 outlet.  Recent 
improvements to drainage along Highway 21 are expected to address this issue. 
 
Northwest Portion: The Kenorus campground, which experiences seasonal flooding, receives runoff from the 
area to the east via a culvert under the Rail Trail.  The ditch system along Goderich Street, which drains the 
water south to Concession 10, appears to have sufficient capacity however has a shallow slope.  In order to 
reduce the runoff draining into the Kenorus Campground, the construction of a drainage ditch along the Rail Trail 
south to Concession 10 could be investigated.  Alternatively, a SWM Pond upstream from the campground could 
be considered. 
 
Southeast Portion:  
 Some residential areas in the south-east corner of this catchment were developed with drainage pits. 
Seasonal flooding has been identified in some of these areas.   
 The Police Station, which is located on MacKenzie Road between Concession Road 10 and Tomlinson 
Drive, was recently built with a Stormwater Management Plan.  The roads in this area have a relatively flat 
grade.  There is an infiltration basin in the Mackenzie Road ROW.  The overland flow route is to the west 
along Hepner Crescent.  Drainage improvements could potentially be achieved by adjusting the slopes of 
the road, installing a new storm sewer along Concession 10 to Goderich Street and/or connecting and 
installing more drainage pits. 
 Frequent standing water has also been noted to the south of Tomlinson Drive, along Wellington Street and 
to the east across the Rail Trail into a proposed development property. 
 
Southwest Portion (Stormwater Management Pond): 
The original catchment area for the SWM pond included properties to the west of Goderich Street generally 
between Tomlinson Drive and Mary Street, including the Independent Grocery Store.  The Summerside 
development has included properties within the subject catchment area that drain to a different catchment (i.e. 
to Stream No.2 – Outlet No.18).  In addition, Kingsway Arms Elgin Lodge, which is located on Mary Street, is 
currently a “drainage island” with no outlet, which stores and infiltrates surface water.  The logical outlet for this 
‘island’ is to the west, where overland flow through the Northport subdivision to the Lord Elgin Estates stormwater 
management facility (I.e. Outlet No.20: Trillium Drive) would naturally occur.  However, the overland flow routes 
and capacity of the SWM facility for Lord Elgin Estates was not designed to accommodate this flow.  
 
FUTURE DRAINAGE NEEDS 
1. Industrial park development is expected to continue, where shown on Drawing C-17. 
2. Ongoing development in the Summerside subdivision development is expected.  The trunk storm sewer 
along Concession 10 was designed to have sufficient capacity to convey the post-development flow rates 
from a portion of the subdivision, more specifically the lands within Lot 50 Lake Range.  
3. The property parcel which contains the Stormwater Management Pond is identified as a potential 
development area.  Any changes to the SWM Pond should be carefully reviewed.

4. The planned development to the east of the Rail Trail and south of Concession 10 will likely require a 
stormwater management facility, potentially between the Rail Trail and the westerly extent of Tomlinson 
Drive and/or across from the end of Tomlinson Drive.  Peak flow for the 2-year and 5-year storm will likely 
be required to be limited to the available capacity in the 900mmØ storm sewer system on Tomlinson Drive.  
For larger storm events, the stormwater management requirements for the future development will likely 
be to limit post-development flows to pre-development flow rates.  Conveyance to the Tomlinson Drive 
storm sewer system will have to be verified with the future development plan(s). 
 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
1. Priority: High 
Review available capacity in Concession 10 trunk sewer.  Design and install a storm sewer along Cutter 
Road with a connection to the Concession 10 outlet, the Stream No.2 outlet or possibly a new outlet to Lake 
Huron.    
2. Priority: Medium 
Construct a new ditch along the Rail Trail to the south of Concession 10 to reduce the runoff draining into 
the Kenorus Campground or provide a stormwater management pond to prevent local flooding. 
3. Priority: Low 
To address the issues observed in the southeast portion of the subject catchment area (i.e. flooding and 
standing water), namely in the vicinity of the Police Station, drainage improvements could be achieved by 
installing a new storm sewer along Concession 10 to Goderich Street and/or connecting and installing more 
drainage pits.  More site-specific solutions may need to be reviewed. 
4. Priority: Low 
Localized ponding issues in the Wellington Street area may be addressed by maintaining the installed 
drainage pits.  These pits will fill with sand over time that will need to be removed as part of regular scheduled 
maintenance.  Positive connections to a storm sewer outlet should further be considered for isolated 
drainage pits. 
 
11.4.4 Outlet No.18: Stream No.2 
Drainage for this area is planned under the Summerside Subdivision Stormwater Management Plan.  As shown 
in Drawing B-18, this catchment is bound by Goderich Street, Normanton Street, Lake Huron, and future Street 
Nine planned for the Summerside subdivision (or the boundary between Lot 49 and 50 Lake Range).  Many low-
lying ponding/swampy areas have been noted.   
 
This catchment drains to a Stormwater Management Facility below the bluff and then outlets to a natural 
watercourse which was identified as Stream No.2 in the Summerside subdivision planned servicing report.  The 
natural watercourse drains to Lake Huron near Hilly Lane.  No significant outlet is present for this catchment.  
Stormwater culverts and mains in this area are only 375mm in diameter.  At this time, development in the 
Summerside subdivision is in its early stages.  Woodlands Subdivision is currently being considered.

RECOMMENDATIONS 
Significant seasonal flooding occurs along North 
Shore Road and Cutter Road near the outlet of this 
watercourse.  The current outlet to Lake Huron is 
likely undersized, resulting in overland flow under 
minor storms.  A new outlet should be sized and 
constructed to convey up to the 5-year storm through 
the residential areas.   
As previously discussed, drainage from along Cutter 
Road (i.e. from within the Concession 10 catchment) 
may be able to be directed to the improved outlet for 
Stream No.2. 
 
Planned development east 
of North Shore Road is part 
of a future phase of the Lord 
Elgin Estates development. 
Woodlands subdivision is 
currently being considered.  
 
 
Evaluate a new outlet to 
Lake Huron near Hilly 
Lane based on planned 
developments.   
No capital projects

11.4.5 Outlet No.19: Bushwood Lane 
Drainage for this area is planned under the Lord Elgin Estates Subdivision Stormwater Management Plan.  This 
is a small catchment that drains the area from north of Summerside Place/Northport Drive and west of Highland 
Street down the bluff to Lake Huron.  A stream, identified as Stream No.3 in the Master Servicing Plan for Lord 
Elgin Estates completed by Genivar, arises below the bluff.  As shown on Drawing B-19, at the intersection of 
Fenton Drive and Acton Drive (i.e. in the northwest area of the catchment), Stream No.3 enters a 900mmØ storm 
sewer system and is conveyed to an outlet at the westerly extent of Bushwood Lane.  Drainage via storm sewers, 
which connect into the main 900mmØ storm, is currently provided for approximately 200 m of Fenton Drive, 
between Trillium Drive and Bushwood Lane, and 200 m of Acton Drive from Westgate Drive north to Fenton 
Drive.   
 
It is noted that, based on the available GIS information, the high point along Acton Drive between Westgate Drive 
and Trillium Drive is not clear.  A potential cross connection with the Trillium Drive catchment to the south could 
occur (i.e. Outlet No.20).  Acton Drive and Fenton Drive were identified as potential drainage concerns by the 
Town.  The Woodlands Subdivision Phase 3 development plans intend to extend a storm drainage system on 
Acton Drive from Fenton Drive to about 500 meters northerly.

11.4.6 Outlet No.20: Trillium Drive  
Drainage for this area is planned under the Lord Elgin Estates Subdivision Stormwater Management Plan.  The 
Lord Elgin Estates Developments (LEED), located at the top of the bluff, were generally designed to drain 
westerly to the large stormwater management facility (SWM) situated below the bluff (i.e. SWM Pond A).  As 
shown in Drawing B-20, SWM Pond A has two inlets, a 1350mmØ to the north and a 750mmØ storm sewer to 
the south.  The southerly inlet drains a small catchment in which drainage pits are primarily used to manage 
drainage.  Pond A is considered to be a primary component of the stormwater management system for a larger 
catchment area, including the Lord Elgin Estates Black’s subdivision and Northport Meadows subdivision, which 
drains via the northerly inlet to Pond A.

PAGE 51 OF 73 
The SWM pond (i.e. Pond A) has two outlets.  At the north end of the pond is the primary outlet comprised of a 
twin 300mmØ and 1400mmØ culvert designed to handle a wide range of runoff events.  These drain northerly 
to Biener Pond, which then outflows to LEED Creek.  LEED Creek drains through North Shore Park and 
discharges to Lake Huron south of the intersection of Stevens Street and McVicar Street via a twinned culvert.  
The second outlet from Pond A drains to the south via a 300mmØ culvert, which maintains the flow in a creek 
and eventually outlets to Lustig Lane then Market Street (i.e. Outlet No.21). 
 
The local drainage along Trillium Drive is picked up by a storm sewer system which drains westerly along Trillium 
Drive and outlets to Lake Huron via a 900mmØ storm sewer. 
 
These systems were all reviewed and approved at the time of the subdivision development.

11.4.7 Outlet No.21: Market Street 
The Market Street storm sewer system was planned under a Schedule B Municipal Class Environmental 
assessment process in 2006 (GMBP File No. M-1524).  The recommended trunk storm sewer and outlet were 
subsequently developed.  As shown in Drawing B-21, the catchment area includes lands from Falconer 
Street/River Street to the north, extending south beyond Catherine Street, and is generally between Eastwood 
Drive and Bruce Street, with an additional portion extending along Market Street to the outlet.  As part of this 
Master Drainage Plan, the delineation of this catchment incorporates additional lands to the east of Goderich 
Street which were not previously included in 2006.  During minor storm events, the lands to the east of Goderich 
Street drain predominately by infiltration pits, however, for larger events storm sewer connections to the Goderich 
Street storm sewers at Market Street and Green Street exist.   
 
The existing configuration of main storm sewers is similar to, but not the same as, the previously recommended 
trunk and collector sewer layout and design.  Further, the construction of collector storm sewers on Falconer 
Street, Crawford Street and Market Street are outstanding projects.  
 
Stormwater Management Pond A, which accommodates flows for the Lord Elgin Estates developments, includes 
a secondary outlet to a minor watercourse that also drains southwards and outlets to Lake Huron at the Market 
Street outlet. 
 
DRAINAGE ISSUES 
Localized flooding under heavy rainfall occurs along Crawford Street and about one block east near the Falconer 
Street and Waterloo Street intersection.  Currently Crawford Street is drained mainly by ditches and overland 
flow.  The Market Street Storm Sewer Study recommended a collector storm sewer along Falconer Street.  
Improvements to the road cross section along Crawford Street would be required to ensure drainage is conveyed 
in the road cross section during a major storm.  As an alternative, completing a collector storm sewer along 
Crawford Street, connected to the Falconer Street and Waterloo Street intersection, could also be considered 
(Drawing C-21).   
 
Flooding during rainfall was identified as an issue along Louis Street and Linden Court.  To address these issues, 
an infiltration pit at Linden Court and the construction of storm sewers along Louis Street connecting to Goderich 
Street have been planned.  As such, an urban cross section with storm sewer is planned.  Review of drainage 
improvement alternatives and construction of drainage improvements should proceed.

RECOMMENDATIONS 
1. Priority: High 
Review urban versus rural cross section.  Construct drainage improvements at Linden Court.   
2. Priority: High 
Review urban versus rural cross section.  Proceed with drainage improvements along Louis Street. 
3. Priority: Medium 
Construct the previously planned trunk storm sewer along Falconer Street and complete road improvements 
along Crawford Street to improve drainage.  As an alternative, construct a trunk storm sewer along Crawford 
Street and connect to the Falconer Street and Waterloo Street intersection.    
4. Priority: Medium 
Construct the balance of the Market Street trunk storm sewer.  The system may need to be re-evaluated 
given the existing constructed condition relative to the original plan.    
 
11.4.8 Outlet No.22: South End Drain 
Drainage for this area was originally planned under the South End Drains Design Report and was subsequently 
updated with the Bluewater Estates Subdivision Stormwater Management Plan.  As shown on Drawing B-22, 
this large catchment area extends from the Rail Trail west to within about 150 meters of Lake Huron, between 
Pierson Ave/Catherine Street and Barnes Ave.  Drainage within the catchment is generally achieved as follows:  
 
The most easterly area along the Rail Trail generally drains from the drainage divide along the Rail Trail, 
east towards Wellington Street then west to Lake Huron.   
 
The tablelands area is drained to a stormwater management facility which controls the peak flow rates 
from above the bluff, and outlets to the watercourse below the bluff.   
 
A series of natural ponds and watercourses exists below the bluff and drains to Lake Huron near the 
intersection of Shipley Ave and McKinnon Lane via a 1500mmØ culvert.

11.4.9 Outlet No.23: Shipley Creek 
This catchment area drains an area north of Bruce Road 25 between the future Ridge Street and Shipley Avenue, 
as well as a rural area to the south of Bruce Road 25 extending from the Gore Drain west to the Baker 
Subdivision, where shown on Drawing B-23.   
 
A 750mmØ culvert crossing of Bruce Road 33 directs runoff from south of BR25 and east of BR33 to a wetland 
area located directly to the southwest of the intersection of Bruce Road 25 and Bruce Road 33.  A watercourse 
arises on the northwest side of the wetland, which flows in a northerly direction along the west side of Shipley 
Avenue, across private properties, discharging to Lake Huron via the Shipley Creek outlet.  Drainage in the area 
to the north of Bruce Road 25 and west of the future Ridge Street, which include the UNIFOR lands, generally 
flows via watercourses to the west then is directed via a series of storm sewers, culverts and ditches towards 
Shipley Avenue. 
 
The majority of the drainage planning for lands south of Bruce Road 25 was considered under the Bruce County 
Roads 25 and 33 Master Plan for Roads and Drainage (GMBP File No. M-1552) and under a Schedule B EA 
process for the re-alignment of Bruce Road 33 (GMBP File No. 217127).  Detailed design for Bruce Road 33 will 
address additional issues in consultation with the SVCA.

FUTURE DRAINAGE NEEDS 
 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
Localized ponding and standing water 
occur along Shipley Avenue.  Regular 
maintenance of storm sewers, culverts 
and ditches along Shipley Avenue and 
along connecting roads should be 
completed. 
 
Planned development exists to the 
south of Bruce Road 25, which will 
need to address the site-specific 
stormwater management planning.  
 
General Maintenance: 
Complete routine maintenance of 
storm sewers, culverts and 
ditches on an annual, semi-
annual or as-needed basis.  
 
11.4.10 Outlet No.24: Bruce Road 25 
The Bruce Road 25 storm sewer system was planned as part of a Master Plan for Roads and Drainage (2017) 
specific to Bruce Roads 25 and 33, which followed the Municipal Class EA process.  The Master Plan (2017) 
resolved the direction for drainage planning within the broader Study Area, including the majority of the 
catchment areas for Shipley Creek and the Baker Subdivision (i.e. Outlet No.23 and Outlet No.25).  The preferred 
plan for drainage generally considered maintaining flows within the catchment area within which the flows arise.   
 
In general, the system is designed as a trunk sewer system draining westerly along BR25 to an outlet at Lake 
Huron and includes provisions for stormwater quality management.  The planned trunk storm sewer along Bruce 
Road 25 is designed primarily to collect flows from developed and planned development lands north of County 
Road 25, including commercial lands along Goderich Street, where shown on Drawing B-24.  However, as 
development proceeds in the area, they too will be required to appropriately address stormwater quantity and 
quality.  
 
The storm sewer system along Bruce Road 25 between Lake Range Road and Goderich Street (i.e. Phases 2 
and 3) is planned to provide capacity to convey runoff from the 1:100-year return rainfall event within the road 
cross section.  Water quality provisions include a system of perforated pipes in clear stone trenches connected 
below the storm sewer inverts to store and percolate stormwater into the ground.  Between Lake Range Road 
and the westerly extent of Bruce Road 25, the trunk sewer is sized to convey the 1:5-year storm event to the 
1200mmØ outlet to Lake Huron.  Discharge and spills to Shipley Creek provide peak flushing flows through the 
existing watercourse, as recommended by the Fish Habitat and Aquatic Impact Assessment Reports completed 
to support the Master Plan (2017).  The 1:100 year peak flows in Shipley Creek are expected to be only slightly 
reduced once the construction of the Bruce Road 25 storm sewer system is completed.

RECOMMENDATIONS 
None Identified 
 
Planned development exists to the 
north of Bruce Road 25 and to the 
south of this catchment, in the area 
to the east of Bruce Road 33.  
 1. Implementation: Continue to implement the 
drainage system as outlined in the Master 
Plan for Roads and Drainage (2017) 
prepared for Bruce Roads 25 and 33.  
2. Planned Development: Ensure that 
individual developments appropriately 
address stormwater quality and quantity 
issues.  
 
11.4.11 Outlet No.25: Baker Subdivision 
Drainage within this catchment was originally planned in about 2005 (GMBP File No. M-1532), but was also 
considered as part of the Master Plan for Roads and Drainage (2017) specific to Bruce Roads 25 and 33.  As 
shown in Drawing B-25, this catchment includes the lands west of the Gore Drain (along the former Gore Road) 
and abuts the Shipley Creek catchment to the south.  This area drains to the west through the Baker Subdivision.  
Drainage across the Bruce Road 33 (or Lake Range Road) is through a 750mmØ culvert situated approximately 
100 meters to the south of Baker Road.  In general, drainage is then directed towards Baker Road then continues 
along Baker Road through ditches and culverts to a twin 600mmØ culvert that outlets to Lake Huron.  
 
The Baker Subdivision was developed as a cottage community with a network of ditches to achieve drainage. 
The elevation of this area is relatively low and, as a result, many buildings and roads have been constructed 
near the seasonally high groundwater table.  Consequently, this area experiences poor drainage and seasonal 
flooding issues.  Previous drainage studies have considered the installation of storm sewer systems, 
appropriately to drain this area; including the provision of an additional outlet at the George Street boat launch.  
Although the area is serviced with watermains, sanitary sewers do not exist.  Considering the significant cost 
and disruption to install a storm sewer system, the Town continues to pursue funding to simultaneously install a 
network of sanitary sewers and storm sewers.    
 
DRAINAGE ISSUES 
The Baker subdivision experiences seasonal flooding. 
 
FUTURE DRAINAGE NEEDS 
 Planned development areas exist between the existing Bruce Road 33, the Official Plan settlement areas 
boundaries and the Gore Drain catchment to the east (refer to Drawing C-25).  These lands will need to 
appropriately manage their own stormwater. 
 As part of the planning process for the area (Master Plan, 2017) and subsequent EA process specific to 
Bruce Road 33, the County plans to re-align Bruce Road 33 from south of Baker Road to the intersection 
of Bruce Road 25 with the future Bruce Street alignment.  Following the construction of the re-aligned 
Bruce Road 33, which is planned for 2022, the catchment boundaries within the north-east portion of the 
catchment area may change to include a small area between the re-aligned Bruce Road 33, Bruce Road 
25 and the Gore Drain catchment.  In addition, a new SWM Facility in proximity to the Lake Range Road 
and Baker Road intersection is planned to be constructed by the County to manage stormwater along the

re-aligned Bruce Road 33.  Stormwater management for future development in this area would be required 
to be constructed on-site and to control post-development flow rates to pre-development flow rates. 
 A storm sewer system should be installed throughout the Baker Subdivision. 
 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
1. Priority: High 
The Town should continue to advance the planning and design for the simultaneous installation of a 
sanitary sewer collection system and storm sewer system within the Baker Subdivision, including the 
provision for an additional outlet at George Street.  Funding to implement this comprehensive project 
should continue to be pursued.  
2. Future Development: 
Future development should be required appropriately to manage stormwater as it relates to the 
development, generally to maintain post-development peak flow rates to pre-development peak flow rates, 
where possible. 
 
11.4.12 Outlet No.26: Gore Drain 
The Gore Drain is a Municipal Drain that was established in 1971 under Township of Saugeen Bylaw No.6-71 
(GMBP File No. D-1045).  The municipal drain manages flows from an area to the east (i.e. Highway 21), with 
the northerly limit of the catchment extending approximately 500 meters east of the drain and along the north 
side of Concession 6 and the southerly limit extending to about one-kilometer east of the Gore Drain in the 
vicinity of Concession Road 4.  As shown in Drawing B-26, the Gore Drain directs drainage to the southwest 
along the Gore Trail (previously Gore Road) and then flows in a westerly direction to a natural watercourse that 
originates in the area between Bruce Road 33 and the Gore Trail.  Drainage then follows the natural watercourse 
across Bruce Road 33, then further to the west across Saugeen Beach Road and outlets to Lake Huron.  
 
A recent review of the original Municipal Drain (MD) report was undertaken by the Town to assess the need for 
an updated report.  It was determined by a Professional Drainage Engineer that the report requires an update to 
adequately address the maintenance and illegal crossings.  
 
DRAINAGE ISSUES 
 
FUTURE DRAINAGE NEEDS 
 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
The Municipal Drain occasionally fills 
with snow and ice, which can cause 
spills to the west.  Drain inspection 
and clean-out, as necessary, should 
be completed under the Drainage 
Act, with costs apportioned to 
landowners as per the assessment 
schedule.     
 
Potential development on the west 
side of Highway 21 south of 
Concession 6 would ultimately drain 
to the municipal drain. 
Potential development along Bruce 
Road 33 within the catchment would 
ultimately drain to the natural 
watercourse. 
 1. Routine Maintenance: The 
drain should be inspected and 
cleaned out, as necessary. 
2. Low Priority: The construction 
of a berm along the west side of 
Gore Drain may help to prevent 
spills but may affect the 
downstream system.  Additional 
study would be required.   
3. Medium Priority:  Update the 
Municipal Drain Report.

11.4.13 Outlet No.27: Mill Creek Urban Area 
The Mill Creek urban catchment area is relatively large and includes the area of the Mill Creek catchment that is 
situated within the settlement area boundaries of the Town’s Official Plan.  As shown on Drawing B-27, this area 
extends primarily along the west side Mill Creek and includes a Golf Course development to the east of Mill 
Creek, situated to the southwest of the intersection of Bruce Road 17 and Sideroad13/14.  Mill Creek generally 
flows in a northerly direction and converges with the Saugeen River approximately 400 meters east of the 
catchment area limits.     
 
The urban portion of the Mill Creek Urban catchment is generally within the lower reach of the Mill Creek 
watershed and typically drains directly to the main branch of the Creek.  Mill Creek is not likely affected by 
drainage associated with runoff from the minor amount of development that lies within the its catchment area 
boundaries.  In other words, developments that already exist are not likely impacting peak flows in this natural 
watercourse.   
  
The timing of peak flow releases from future development in this area could become superimposed with greater 
peak flows from the Mill Creek Rural area if stormwater management facilities are designed to extend the 
duration of the peak flow.   
 
As this is a natural watercourse, generally limiting post-development peak flow rates to pre-development peak 
flow rates should be respected for future developments.  In addition, the time to peak flow from the development 
should be less than the time to peak flow for Mill Creek Rural watershed.  In cases where both objectives cannot 
be achieved simultaneously, the second objective should take priority. 
 
DRAINAGE ISSUES 
Westlinks residential development and The Club at Westlinks golf course is an ongoing phased development 
situated within the catchment area to the east of Mill Creek.  Based on a review of the Stormwater Management 
report for the subdivision, drainage is directed to a Wet Pond facility south of Westlinks Drive and outlets to a 
small watercourse that drains to Mill Creek.  Reportedly, the SVCA required quality control but not quantity 
control for the subdivision to prevent superimposition of peak flows.  However, the SWM facility provides some 
quantity control to prevent erosion of the ditch/watercourse that conveys flows to Mill Creek.   
 
FUTURE DRAINAGE NEEDS 
The zoning in this area is a mix of Resource Extraction, Commercial, Open Space, Residential, and Hazard 
Lands. Current planned development areas along Concession 6 are zoned Open Space.  Based on the 
discussions above, stormwater management considerations for development, if required, should include peak 
flow timing for any drainage directed to Mill Creek. 
 
Lands along the west side of Sideroad 13/14 south of Bruce Road 17 are currently zoned commercial and 
residential and are part of the draft Plan of Subdivision for Westlinks (i.e. future development phases). It is 
recommended that drainage considerations for the future phases of development consider peak flow timings in 
developing their stormwater management systems.  Based on the discussions above, a shorter time to peak flow 
may reduce downstream peak flow rates. 
 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
1. No capital projects recommended. 
2. Future Development: 
Stormwater management considerations of development, if required, should include peak flow timing for 
any drainage directed to Mill Creek.

11.4.14 Outlet No.28: Infiltration Area 
As shown in Drawing B-28, this catchment area is characterized by residential development and is generally 
bound by the Lehnen Street Road allowance west to Bricker Street, and from Ashwell Cresent and Woodland 
Drive south to the north side of River Street.  Stormwater in this area is currently managed by infiltration pits with 
no connections to existing storm sewers or established outlets.  In general, the land slopes downward to the 
west.  Goderich Street, which parallels the western extent of this catchment area, prevents overland flow to the 
west as it is topographically elevated relative to the surrounding lands.  There is no watercourse, storm sewer, 
or designated overland flow route to convey stormwater from this catchment to an adequate outlet.  
 
The majority of the soil in this area is identified as Brady sandy loam with imperfect drainage.  The soil type in 
the southeast corner of this area is Fox sandy loam which is known to have good infiltration capabilities.  Fox 
sandy loam is the predominant soil type to the south where infiltration pits are also predominant and more 
successful. 
 
DRAINAGE ISSUES 
Ponding reportedly occurs along Arlington Street and in the vicinity of the intersection of River Street and 
Wellington Street.  Calculations completed by the Town of Saugeen Shores suggest the infiltration pits may be 
overwhelmed with even a 1:2 year design storm.   
 
Stormwater management for the Lord Elgin Estates developments to the west within the Trillium Drive Catchment 
(i.e. Outlet No.20), including the Summerside subdivision, did not include these upgradient lands in their 
stormwater management planning.  While a sufficient outlet for this area was not specifically identified, drainage 
to the Market Street outlet to the southwest may be possible.  As such, a drainage study to determine the best 
outlet option(s) and infrastructure required to convey the stormwater is recommended. 
 
FUTURE DRAINAGE NEEDS 
None identified. 
 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
Priority: High 
Complete a Drainage Study to determine a suitable positive outlet for this area.  Design and construct required 
capital works to connect to an outlet.

RURAL AREAS 
12.1 Drainage Area: Sub Catchments 
This section of the Master Plan focuses on the rural areas within the Town of Saugeen Shores, generally defined 
as areas outside the Settlement Area boundaries, where shown on Figure 1-1.  Rural catchments generally 
have a predominance of lands zoned as rural, agricultural and/or environmental protection (i.e. hazard lands), 
and surface water is generally unmanaged or conveyed via ditches and culverts.  As shown in Drawing A-5, this 
area is divided into six rural catchment areas, identified as follows:

12.2 Existing Conditions and Typical Land Use 
12.2.1 Official Plan: Zoning 
In the Town of Saugeen Shores, the majority of the area outside of the urban areas including Southampton and 
Port Elgin is considered to drain within rural catchment areas, which total approximately 13,750 hectares.  As 
shown in Drawing A-5, the area generally includes lands east of Southampton (i.e. Links Sideroad) and Port 
Elgin, as well as the area to the south of Port Elgin.  It also includes one catchment between Southampton and 
Port Elgin that abuts Lake Huron to the west and an area north of the Southampton which drains to the Saugeen 
River.  As outlined in Table 12-2, greater than 90% of the land use in this area is zoned as agricultural and 
Environmental Protection.

12.2.2 Physiography 
According to the Bruce County Soil Survey, Soil Survey of Ontario, 1983, the majority of the soils in this area 
have good or imperfect drainage.  Areas with good and excessive drainage are typically found along the shore 
of Lake Huron (Plainfield Sand) and in the Links Sideroad area (Bridgeman Sand), which is identified as a beach 
area in the available ‘Physiography of Southern Ontario’ mapping.  The soils in the river and stream bottoms are 
typically described as having ‘variable’ drainage.  Based on the information available, the soil drainage in the 
area, presented as a percent of the total area, is provided in Figure 12-1. 
 
FIGURE 12-1: Soil Drainage as a Percent of the Total Area: Rural Areas 
 
12.2.3 Existing Infrastructure  
Road Crossings: Bridges and Culverts 
In general, surface water in this area is not controlled and is conveyed through natural watercourses.  Structural 
road crossings of watercourses include 14 bridges and culverts, of which 13 are owned by the Town of Saugeen 
Shores and one is managed by the County of Bruce.  Culverts that are considered to be ‘structurally significant’, 
similar to a bridge, are those that are greater than 3 meters in diameter or height.  A Biennial Bridge Inspection 
Report outlines the condition of each of these structures.   
 
Non-structural culverts are defined by the MTO to be less than 3 meters in diameter or height.  A network of 
ditches and approximately 212 ‘non-structural’ culverts convey drainage along or across the rural roads to the 
natural watercourses.  These non-structural culverts can generally be described as follows:  
 156 culverts have a known diameter.  These culverts range between 300mmØ and 2000mmØ.   
 Approximately 56 culverts have an unknown diameter.  
 According to the Towns GIS database, an estimated 186 culverts were reportedly installed in 1970.  
However, it is interpreted that this indicates that these were installed prior to 1970.   
 23 culverts were reportedly installed in the last 30 years (i.e. between 1989 and 2019). 
 
The Town has generally assigned a useful life of 30 years for the non-structural culverts within their network.  In 
consideration of this general measure of useful life, it is estimated that 190 culverts have exceeded their service 
life.

In recent years, drainage tiles have been installed on private agricultural lands.  The Ontario Ministry of 
Agriculture and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA) compiles information regarding tile drains which is available via Land 
Information Ontario and was included in the mapping completed as part of this Master Plan.  It is noted that 
drainage tile information did not provide the outlet or direction of flow of the drainage tiles.  The general 
requirements for agricultural tile drains are provided in Section 5.5 of this Master Drainage Plan.

In general, surface water in this area is not controlled and is conveyed through natural watercourses.  Stormwater 
in the 13,750-hectare drainage area ultimately flows westerly, either directly into Lake Huron or into the Saugeen 
River or a tributary thereof, which then discharges to Lake Huron at the westerly extent of the Saugeen River in 
Southampton (Drawing A-5).  Table 12-3 summarizes the characteristics of the six rural sub catchments 
identified as Rural Catchment No.RC1 through No.RC6.  As outlined in Table 12-1, reference should be made 
to Drawings B-29 through B-34 for more detailed information.

12.3.1 Rural Catchment No.RC1: Mill Creek Rural Area 
This is a large catchment in the southern-central portion of the Town of Saugeen Shores, where shown on 
Drawing B-29.  While the total area of the Mill Creek Rural watershed is approximately 15,390 hectares, only 
an estimated 5,520 hectares of the Mill Creek watershed is within the Town of Saugeen Shores.  The portion of 
this watershed that is situated within Town lands is located within the downstream portion of the watershed and 
an estimated 9,870 hectares is located upgradient within the Municipality of Kincardine.  
 
Land use is predominately agricultural, with some areas of resource extraction and minimal residential or 
commercial zoning, namely in the Hamlet of North Bruce.  As shown on Drawing C-29, tile drains are present 
on approximately 50% of the lands.  Environmental Protection/Hazard zoning is found along most of the 
watercourses, both intermittent and permanent.  
 
Drainage is achieved through a network of intermittent and permanent watercourses, which direct flows to the 
more significant watercourses including Little Mill Creek or directly to Mill Creek.  The outlet of the catchment is 
at the confluence of Mill Creek with the Saugeen River.

DRAINAGE ISSUES 
Bruce Road 40 at Sideroad 13/14:  
Minor flooding from upstream lands has been reported in the area of Bruce Road 40 and Sideroad 13/14.  Field 
investigations identified culverts that were not documented in the Town’s GIS database and noted that one 
quadrant of the intersection to the southeast does not appear to have a drainage outlet. 
 
Bruce Road 17 at Sideroad 13/14:  
Frequent ponded water and flooded fields have been noted on the east side of Sideroad 13/14 to the south of 
Bruce Road 17.  Consistent with this reported drainage issue, during field investigations completed as part of 
this Master Plan, the culvert under Sideroad 13/14 was observed to be submerged and the field to the southeast 
of the intersection was flooded.  The field in the immediate southeast quadrant of this intersection has a flat 
grade and although a ditch is present along Bruce Road 17, no ditch exists along the east side of Sideroad 13/14.  
Minor ditching improvements along Sideroad 13/14 may promote an outlet for field drainage.   
 
Highway 21 at Concession 4/Bruce Road 40: 
Drainage concerns were identified at the Bruce Road 40/Concession 4 crossing of Highway 21.  Both the 
northeast and southeast quadrants of this intersection are low and wet with a small pond present in the southeast 
quadrant.  Drainage would appear to be overland to the NE from the SE quadrant as a low rise is present along 
the west side of Highway 21.  This may be a watercourse (intermittent) regulated by the SVCA. 
 
Concession Road 2 at Sideroad 28/29: 
Generally, the fields in each of the four quadrants are flat graded. Overall drainage is downward to the west.  
Roadside ditches could be improved along each of the four legs of this intersection to provide an improved outlet 
for area drainage westerly along Concession 2.   
 
FUTURE DRAINAGE NEEDS 
The majority of this catchment area is agricultural and is situated outside of the Official Plan settlement area 
boundaries.  As a result, urban development is not expected in this area.  
  
RECOMMENDATIONS 
1. Priority: Low 
Capital Project to install a new culvert crossing of Sideroad 13/14 directly south of Bruce Road 40.  As the 
catchment area for this culvert is relatively small, this project is considered to be low priority.  
2. Priority: Low 
Complete drainage improvements to address flooding issues at southeast corner of Sideroad 13/14 and 
Bruce Road 17.  Minor ditching improvements along Sideroad 13/14 may promote an outlet for field 
drainage.   
3. Priority: Low 
Roadside ditches could be improved along each of the four legs of the intersection of Concession 2 and 
Sideroad 28/29 to provide an improved outlet for area drainage westerly along Concession 2.     
4. Maintenance: 
Maintain, replace (as necessary), and clean out the culverts and ditches between Bruce Road 17 and 
Concession 6, including along the Rail Trail and along Sideroad 13/14.  Maintenance of culverts in the 
vicinity of the intersection of Concession 2 and Sideroad 28/29 should also be completed, where shown on 
Drawing C-29.

12.3.2 Rural Catchment No.RC2: Upper Saugeen River 
As shown in Drawing B-30, this catchment includes the Saugeen River from the southeasterly extent of the 
Town of Saugeen Shores to the confluence with Mill Creek, which is located to the east of Port Elgin.  It does 
not include either of the Mill Creek or Burgoyne Creek catchments but does include smaller unnamed 
watercourses that drain directly to the Saugeen River.  
 
Much of this area is zoned Environmental Protection/Hazard lands, with the adjacent land use being 
predominantly agricultural.  A small portion of Open Space is associated with the Saugeen Bluffs Conservation 
Area.  Most of the agricultural lands, and some of the Environmental Protection/Hazard Lands, are reported to 
have tile drains.

12.3.3 Rural Catchment No.RC3: Burgoyne Creek 
As shown in Drawing B-31, this catchment area is encompassed by the easterly limit of the Upper Saugeen 
River catchment and the east boundary of the Town of Saugeen Shores.  The associated watersheds for 
Burgoyne Creek and Snake Creek extend easterly beyond the Town limits for the Town of Saugeen Shores.  It 
includes Burgoyne Creek and its tributary Snake Creek.  Burgoyne Creek outlets to the Saugeen River to the 
south of the intersection of Bruce Road 17 with The River Road.   
 
Lands within this catchment are primarily zoned agricultural, with some Environmental Protection/Hazard lands 
along Burgoyne Creek, Snake Creek and their tributaries.  Tile drains are found within the majority of the 
agricultural land in this area.  The hamlet of Burgoyne is zoned as a Residential area.

Road 3 south to the Saugeen River, is located to the west of the Saugeen River and east of Doll Sideroad.  
 
The majority of this catchment is zoned Agricultural with some Environmental Protection/Hazard lands, Open 
Space and Resource Extraction.  Tile drains are present within this catchment area, but most of the agricultural 
land remains un-drained.

12.3.5 Rural Catchment No.RC5: MacGregor Point 
The MacGregor Point catchment area is situated to the south of Port Elgin and abuts Lake Huron to the west. 
The majority of the land within this catchment is either zoned as Environmental Protection/Hazard lands or Open 
Space, with a limited area of agricultural lands to the east.  Of the 1,948-hectares within this catchment area, an 
estimated 32 hectares of agricultural land is reportedly drained using tile drains, where shown in Drawing C-33.  
In addition, MacGregor Point Provincial Park, which occupies the lands to the south of the settlement area 
boundary, between Bruce Road 33 and the Lake Huron shoreline, occupies an estimated 1,200 hectares, or 
about two-thirds of the entire drainage area.   
 
Drainage of surface water runoff from the westerly portion of this catchment is generally achieved by overland 
flow which is directed into Lake Huron.  However, flows that originate within the easterly portion are intersected 
by the Whitting Municipal Drain, where shown on Drawing B-33.  The Whitting Drain directs flows to the south, 
beyond the Study Area, into the Municipality of Kincardine.

12.3.6 Rural Catchment No.RC6: Miramichi Bay 
This small catchment, situated between the Southampton and Port Elgin urban settlement areas, drains westerly 
from a drainage divide at Links Sideroad to Lake Huron.  As shown in Drawing B-34, a high bluff follows a north–
south alignment approximately 800 meters east of the Lake Huron shoreline.  Above the bluff, the land use is 
predominantly agricultural, with some commercial properties along Highway 21 and Resource Extraction along 
Links Sideroad.  A portion of the agricultural land reportedly has tile drains.  In addition, the Saugeen Rail Trail 
extends centrally across the area between the top of the bluff and Links Sideroad.  Areas zoned as Environmental 
Protection/Hazard lands occur along the watercourses above the bluff and in the undeveloped areas that exist 
below the bluff.  Some residential areas exist along the shores of Lake Huron. 
 
The area above the bluff is relatively flat, sloping gently to the west.  With the exception of a few small intermittent 
watercourses, drainage of these lands west from Links Sideroad to the top of the bluff is primarily achieved by 
sheet flow.  Below the bluff, intermittent and permanent watercourses arise from groundwater springs that direct 
drainage to Lake Huron.  
 
DRAINAGE ISSUES 
Frequent flooding of agricultural fields has been noted to occur in the agricultural areas of this catchment, above 
the bluff.  Flow spills into this catchment may occur along the Rail Trail south of Bruce Road 3.  However, routine   
maintenance of the ditches and culverts along the rail trail may help to ameliorate this issue.

FUTURE DRAINAGE NEEDS 
Currently, there are two planned developments along the northerly and southerly limits of this catchment, below 
the bluff and within the settlement area boundaries.  These are located along the north side of South Street and 
to the north of Collard Way.  There are other areas east of Miramichi Bay Road, currently zoned Hazard Lands, 
which may be considered for development. 
 
The intermittent watercourse along South Street crosses private properties in close proximity to residential 
buildings. As such, development along South Street should ensure peak flow rates in the intermittent watercourse 
are not increased.  
 
With the Official Plan review ongoing, the settlement area boundaries outlined in the Official Plan may change. 
Since these lands lie between the urban settlement areas of Southampton and Port Elgin, the boundary in this 
area may be subject to change in the future.  In the long-term, this area could be considered for more 
development.  As would be expected, stormwater management planning should be required for any new 
development.  In addition, any road works along Miramichi Bay Road should include consideration of culvert and 
ditch requirements to support drainage for the several watercourses in the area and local drainage. 
 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
Maintenance: 
Complete routine maintenance of culverts and ditches along the Rail Trail on an annual, semi-annual or as-
needed basis, where shown on Drawing C-34.

MASTER PLAN: SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDED SOLUTIONS 
 
The intention of the Master Plan process is ultimately to identify a broad level approach toward addressing the 
identified problems and/or opportunities.  Based on the preliminary level of review completed as part of the 
Master Drainage Plan (Draft for Review), the Plan identifies recommended infrastructure improvements required 
to address the existing drainage deficiencies and future drainage needs identified within the Town of Saugeen 
Shores.   
 
Drainage within the Town of Saugeen Shores primarily flows to either the Saugeen River or to Lake Huron.  The 
Study Area is bound by the municipal limits of the Town of Saugeen Shores and, for the purpose of this Master 
Plan, the Town was subdivided into four main Drainage Study Areas (Figure 1-1), as follows:      
Drainage Study Area No.1:  Southampton North of the River  
Drainage Study Area No.2:  Southampton South of the River  
Drainage Study Area No.3:  Port Elgin 
Drainage Study Area No.4:  Rural Areas 
 
As illustrated on Drawings A-2 through Drawing A-5, each of the four drainage study areas are further 
subdivided into component catchment areas.  The B-series drawings illustrate the existing conditions.  The C-
Series of Drawings illustrate the main recommendations, and direction for, this Master Plan, resulting from the 
process.  The following Table 13-1 provides a prioritized schedule for project implementation and associated 
‘Order of Magnitude’ Construction Costs.   
 
Recommendations presented within this Master Drainage Plan are accompanied by a High, Medium or Low 
priority ‘rating’, a cost estimate and classification of the EA Project Schedule associated with the recommended 
works.  A High priority correlates to a proposed implementation timeline of between 0 and 5 years, Medium 
between 5 and 10 years, and Low for 10 years and beyond.  Cost estimates may not include for other 
infrastructure works, which may be associated with the considered drainage infrastructure costs, including such 
items as watermain relocation etc. 
 
It is noted that the recommendations summarized in Table 13-1 are focused on larger-scale recommended 
infrastructure improvements.  Table 13-1 also identifies where general maintenance within a component 
catchment is recommended for a given element of the drainage system.  For additional details regarding the 
recommended maintenance needs, reference should be made to the discussions and summary of 
recommendations provided in Section 9 through Section 13 of this Master Drainage Plan.

3. * With planned development (approved under the Planning Act). 
 
 
General Maintenance: 
It is noted that lack of maintenance is one of the main reasons for poor system performance.  During the first two 
years of operation, inspections after significant storms will ensure the system is functioning properly.  After this, 
annual system inspections are usually done to identify maintenance needs.  In general, routine maintenance of 
ditches, culverts and storm sewers throughout the Town should be completed on an annual, bi-annual, or as-
needed basis.  With respect to culvert maintenance and clean-out, it is noted that if greater than 10 years has 
lapsed since the last maintenance was completed, the works may be subject to DFO review.       
 
As noted, several culverts are beyond their service life and replacement should be considered as part of the 
Town’s routine maintenance and asset management program. 
 
Storm Sewer Sizing: Future Needs 
Some components of the existing drainage infrastructure are reaching the end of their service lives.  In 
consideration of previous design practices, historic rainfall data trends, which show a general increasing trend, 
and current climate change models, which suggest an increased frequency and intensity of significant rainfall 
events, some of the aging storm sewers may be undersized by current standards.  Therefore, it is recommended 
that the capacity of replacement storm sewer systems be appropriately designed to support the desired levels 
of service for future stormwater management and road reconstruction projects.

Asset Management Program Development: 
It is recommended that the Town develop an Asset Management Program to evaluate non-structural culvert 
conditions and to support planning for repair and replacement work.  The typical lifespan for corrugated steel 
culverts is 30 years.  Based on the information provided in the Towns GIS database, an estimated 55% of the 
Town’s culverts have exceeded their estimated service life.  With planning, replacement work can be completed 
in conjunction with road works.  Ensuring culverts are in good condition can improve drainage and provide a 
higher level of service and safety to the Town’s residents. 
 
Further, in the long term, a storm sewer asset management program, including condition assessments, would 
be beneficial.  Based on the information available, it is estimated that approximately 5% of storm sewer mains 
have exceeded their service life.  
 
 
14. 
PHASE 2 CONSULTATION 
 
Consultation early in and throughout the process is a key feature of environmental assessment planning.  It is 
noted that while the Master Plan addresses the drainage needs and justification at a broad level, more detailed 
studies for each of the projects identified in the Master Plan will need to be completed as part of the planning 
and design process, as necessary.  Further, this Master Drainage Plan is intended sufficiently to document the 
investigations, assessments and consultations required to fulfill the Schedule A and Schedule A+ projects.  More 
detailed project-specific investigations and additional consultation will be necessary to satisfy the requirements 
for specific Schedule B projects, where identified.         
 
As the Master Drainage Plan is intended to address the first two phases of the EA process, the consultation 
process will have two mandatory points of contact; the Notice of Study Commencement and Public Information 
Centre and the Notice of Study Completion.  The Master Drainage Plan will subsequently be finalized and 
presented to Town Council for approval (or otherwise).    
 
14.1 Notice of Study Commencement and Virtual Public Information Centre (PIC No.1) 
A Notice of Study Commencement and Virtual Public Information Centre (PIC No.1) was prepared and first 
issued on December 1, 2020.  The Notice included an invitation to a Virtual Phase 2 Public Information Centre 
to be held December 16, 2020.  A copy of the Notice is provided in Appendix A.  The Notice was advertised in 
the Shoreline Beacon on December 1 and December 8, 2020.  Within the Notice, interested individuals were 
provided the opportunity to be added to a mailing list for future Master Drainage Plan consultations.     
 
The Notice of Study Commencement and Virtual Public Information Centre invites the public, stakeholders, 
agencies and Indigenous Communities to review this first Draft of the Master Drainage Plan.  Comments received 
over the course of the Study will be incorporated into the Master Drainage Plan, which will include a re-
assessment of alternatives, as required, to address comments received, to be issued at a later date.

14.2 Notice of Study Completion 
As previously noted, this Master Plan process is intended to follow Approach #1 (Appendix 4, MCEA Manual 
2015), which involves the completion of a Master Plan document at the conclusion of Phases 1 and 2 of the EA 
process.  Therefore, new information received following the issuance of the Notice of Study Commencement will 
be incorporated into the Plan and the Recommended Solutions to the drainage issues identified and future 
drainage needs will be re-evaluated.  The Notice of Study Completion will then be issued, and the updated 
Master Plan will be made available to the public, stakeholders, agencies and indigenous communities prior to 
finalization of the preferred Master Plan.  The Master Drainage Plan will subsequently be presented to Council 
for approval (or otherwise).   
  
Upon the selection, by Council, of a Preferred Master Plan for drainage systems within the Study Area, individual 
projects may proceed under the appropriate EA Schedule, using the Master Plan as a basis.   
 
15. 
CONSULTATION: PUBLIC, AGENCY AND INDIGENOUS COMMUNITY  
15.1 Public Consultation 
With the circulation of this first draft of the Master Drainage Plan, the public are invited to provide comments 
regarding the set of Preliminary Recommended Solutions identified.  Comments received will be summarized in 
this section.  Upon receipt and review of all comments, the review of the alternatives will be re-visited, and any 
new information will be incorporated into the re-assessment of the Recommended Preferred Solutions. 
15.2 Agency and Indigenous Community Consultation 
Agencies with a regulatory role that may require future permits/approvals, or may have a direct interest in the 
study, are to be contacted at each ‘mandatory point of contact’ required as part of the EA process to invite 
feedback.  This Master Drainage Plan (Draft for Review) was circulated to select key agencies and indigenous 
communities on December 1, 2020 to solicit comments and feedback, which will be incorporated into the 
assessment of the Recommended Preferred Solutions, where appropriate, for consideration and acceptance (or 
otherwise) by Council.  A list of the agencies and Indigenous Communities contacted is included in Appendix 
A.

TOWN OF SAUGEEN SHORES 
NOTICE OF STUDY COMMENCEMENT AND  
VIRTUAL PUBLIC INFORMATION CENTRE (PIC No.1) 
 
GM BluePlan Engineering Limited has been retained by the Town 
of Saugeen Shores (Town) to prepare a Master Drainage Plan 
(Plan) and to undertake a planning process towards identifying 
and addressing drainage deficiencies within the Town limits.  The 
Master Plan is being completed in accordance with Phases 1 and 
2 of the Municipal Class Environmental Assessment (EA) and is 
intended to follow Approach #1 of the Master Planning process 
(Appendix 4, MCEA Manual 2015), which involves the completion 
of a Master Plan document. 
The Town of Saugeen Shores has a complex system for surface 
water drainage, which includes overland sheet flow, natural water 
courses, municipal drains, tile drains, ditches, culverts and storm 
sewers.  Certain areas occasionally experience some drainage 
related issues and, with recent and planned land development, 
the Town intends better to understand the drainage systems.  
Drainage within the Town primarily flows either to the Saugeen 
River or to Lake Huron.  The Study Area is bound by the 
municipal limits of the Town and is subdivided into the following 
main Drainage Study Areas, as shown on the Key Plan:      
Area 1:  Southampton North of the River 
Area 2:  Southampton South of the River 
Area 3:  Port Elgin 
Area 4:  Rural Areas 
The Plan will assist in planning individual projects consistent with 
a comprehensive drainage strategy to assist with more fulsome 
decision making.  This system wide approach provides for a 
strategic level of assessment of various options to better address 
the needs of the Town’s drainage system and to appropriately 
plan various drainage undertakings within the Study Area in a 
comprehensive manner.  Further, the Plan identifies specific 
projects that can be implemented with suggested timelines. 
The Master Drainage Plan includes the development and assessment of alternative solutions to address the deficiencies identified within 
component catchment areas (or subcatchments), providing a Recommended Solution(s) for each area.  The intent of the Plan is to 
complete a broad level of assessment that satisfies the EA requirements for Schedule A/A+ projects, however, more detailed project-
specific investigations to fulfill the requirements for the identified Schedule B projects will be required.  The Master Drainage Plan (Draft 
for Review), which includes drawings containing specific drainage information and a set of preliminary recommended solutions to the 
drainage issues and future drainage needs, is available on the Town’s website for viewing purposes.  Due to COVID-19 restrictions, in-
person services are not available at this time.  When in-person services are possible, the Master Drainage Plan will be made available at 
the Town office for viewing purposes. 
 
PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT 
With the circulation of this Notice and the Master Drainage Plan (Draft for Review), public, stakeholder, agency and indigenous community 
comments are invited for incorporation into the Plan.  Written comments will be received by the Project Team until January 8th, 2021.  
Contact information is provided below.  With the exception of personal information, all comments will become part of the public record. 
Upon receipt of comments, new information received will be incorporated into the Plan and the Recommended Solutions will be re-
evaluated.  The updated Master Plan will then be made available to the public, stakeholders, agencies and indigenous communities prior 
to finalization of the preferred Master Plan.  The Master Drainage Plan will then be presented to Council for approval (or otherwise).

RE:  Town of Saugeen Shores  
 
Master Drainage Plan  
 
Notice of Project Initiation and Virtual Public Information Centre (PIC No.1)  
 
 
I am writing to notify you that the Town of Saugeen Shores is advancing project specific planning to identify 
and address drainage deficiencies, and identify future drainage needs, within the Town.  The Study Area is 
bound by the municipal limits of the Town and is subdivided into four main Drainage Study Areas, as shown 
on the attached Key Plan.  The Master Plan is being completed in accordance with Phases 1 and 2 of the 
Municipal Class Environmental Assessment (EA) as outlined in the Municipal Class Environmental 
Assessment Manual prepared by the Municipal Engineers Association (2015).  It is intended to follow 
Approach #1 of the Master Planning process (Appendix 4, MCEA Manual 2015), which involves the 
completion of a Master Plan document. 
 
We are providing you with the attached Notice of Project Initiation and Virtual Public Information Centre 
(PIC No.1) for the Master Plan, issued on December 1st, 2020.  The Master Drainage Plan (Draft for 
Review), which includes drawings containing specific drainage information and a set of preliminary 
recommended solutions to the drainage issues and future drainage needs, is available on the Town’s 
website for viewing purposes.

STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
5.4.1
General Policies
5.4.1.1
Stormwater management is required to ensure that runoff is controlled so that 
it does not increase peak flows to any greater extent than pre-development 
runoff in watercourses that impact on downstream flooding, to control erosion 
and sedimentation, and to protect and enhance water quality and aquatic 
habitat.  
5.4.1.2
As required by the Town, or other agency, new development proposals may 
be required to be supported by a stormwater management study prepared by 
a qualified professional to determine the effect of increased run-off due to 
development of the site, and to identify stormwater management measures 
as necessary to control any increases in flows in downstream watercourses, 
up to and including the 1:100 year design storm. 
5.4.1.3
Consideration shall also be given to the recommendations of any watershed 
and subwatershed studies.  These studies will provide guidance when 
dealing with any new development within the watershed or subwatershed. 
Subwatershed planning will be supported in areas experiencing urban 
development pressures and in areas where significant environmental 
concerns are identified. Priority areas for subwatershed studies may be 
established in consultation with the Saugeen Valley Conservation Authority.  
Significant findings and recommendations from these studies may result in 
amendments to this Plan.
5.4.1.4
Stormwater management techniques are constantly evolving as well as being 
dependent on the location.  Thus, new development shall promote the use of 
best management practices and standards as approved by the Town, while 
having regard for Sections 1.2.4 and 2.6.
5.4.1.5
Stormwater management studies shall be required for any new residential 
development consisting of more than five lots or for commercial or industrial 
developments with large amounts of impervious area. Such plans may be 
required for other developments, as determined by the Town, if the area has 
existing drainage problems or if runoff could significantly affect adjacent lands 
or water quality.  Priority areas for future study include Bruce Road 25.  
Significant findings and recommendations from these studies will be 
considered when reviewing new development proposals.

SPECIAL POLICY AREA DESIGNATIONS
3.20.1
Special Policy Area #1
3.20.1.1
The area designated as SPA (1) on Schedule “A” Land Use Plan includes 
lands in Port Elgin generally located north of Elgin Street, east of Hilker 
Street, and west of the Rail Trail and a small area of land east of Wellington 
Street immediately north and south of River Street. Due to the proximity to 
the former railway, this area has historically been designated and used for 
industrial purposes. However, with the abandonment of the railway and 
location of these lands along the Rail Trail in an area surrounded by 
established residential neighbourhoods, it is an objective of this Plan to 
encourage re-development of these lands to residential use over the planning 
period.
3.20.1.2
Existing industrial uses within SPA (1) are recognized as permitted uses and 
shall be permitted to continue with limited expansion on their existing sites in 
accordance with the requirements of the implementing Zoning By-law. Any 
proposed change of use of these lands to another form of industrial use shall 
be subject to the policies of the “Employment” designation, Section 3.15 of 
this Plan.
3.20.1.3
The redevelopment of lands within SPA (1) to medium or high density 
residential use is permitted and supported in accordance with the policies for 
the “Residential” designation, Section 3.6 of this Plan. Setbacks may be 
required to existing Industrial uses in accordance with Ministry of the 
Environment Guidelines. Prior to development, the Town may require site 
investigation by a qualified professional to assess potential contamination 
and decommissioning requirements necessary to permit use of the lands for 
residential development.
3.20.2
Special Policy Area #2
3.20.2.1
The residential portion of Southampton located between Lake Huron, the 
Saugeen River, Grosvenor Street, Island Street, Huron Street and Bay Street, 
designated as SPA (2) on Schedule “A” Land Use Plan, is best characterized 
as a well-established low density, low rise residential neighbourhood. Most 
dwellings within this area are one or two storey homes.  The implementing 
Zoning By-law and the assessment of development applications may result in 
the application of reduced height requirements in order to ensure 
compatibility with the built form of the existing community.
3.20.3
Special Policy Area #3
3.20.3.1
It is recognized that the lands designated SPA (3) on Schedule “A” to this 
Plan exhibit environmental hazard features due to flooding and/or poor 
drainage. Development may be permitted in accordance with the Residential 
policies of this Plan, provided a Stormwater Management Study is completed 
demonstrating that concerns regarding flood and fill and floodplain 
management can be dealt with through lot grading and stormwater facilities to 
Mod # 52

Official Plan
Adopted by Council Dec. 10, 2012
Approved by Bruce County: March 26, 2014
the satisfaction of the Town and the Saugeen Valley Conservation Authority.
Furthermore, although the woodlands on the subject property are not 
considered “significant woodlands”, the proponent shall prepare a tree 
retention plan to ensure that tree removal be kept to a minimum for the 
development of the property to the satisfaction of the Town and the Saugeen 
Valley Conservation Authority.
Prior to granting removal of the holding 
symbol in the Comprehensive Zoning By-law to permit residential 
development of any portion of the lands within “Special Policy Area #3”, the 
Town shall consult with the Saugeen Valley Conservation Authority to ensure 
that the stormwater management policies have been appropriately 
addressed.
3.20.4
Special Policy Area #4
3.20.4.1
The area designated as SPA (4) on Schedule “A” Land Use Plan, generally 
encompasses the lands west of the glacial Lake Nipissing bluff, south of 
South Street, in the former Town of Southampton, and north of Lot 19, Lake 
Range, in the former Township of Saugeen, but excludes the former Town of 
Port Elgin and those developed areas existing prior to the date of the 
adoption of this Plan.  It is recognized that much of this special Policy Area 
exhibits important natural heritage features, such as significant woodlands, 
significant wildlife habitat, fish habitat, and species of conservation concern.  
The area also represents a substantial portion of the forested and wetland 
habitats within the planning area, as well as provides local connectivity of the 
natural features.  Further, a large amount of the area consists of hazardous 
lands and sites.  High groundwater conditions and complex drainage are 
common.
3.20.4.2
It is also recognized that new residential uses are permitted in specific and 
limited locations designated as Shoreline Residential that avoid hazardous 
features.  With proper site design, the impacts of the developments on the 
environment can be minimized, to the extent that is possible, and surface and 
sub-surface drainage can be addressed.  Preliminary Environmental Review 
Studies have been completed for most of these specific areas.
3.20.4.3
All lands within SPA (4) not shown as Residential or Shoreline Residential
are designated Environmental Hazard and shall be subject to the policies of 
Section 3.18 of this Plan.  For this Special Policy Area, the Environmental 
Hazard designation includes not just natural hazard elements but also natural 
heritage features.  As such, site alterations and vegetation removal shall not 
be permitted except in accordance with proper forest management practices 
and passive recreation uses, such as hiking trails.
3.20.4.4
Minor adjustments to the Environmental Hazard boundary may not require an 
amendment to this Plan, following consultation with the Saugeen Valley 
Conservation Authority.
3.20.4.5
New development may be permitted in the areas designated Shoreline 
Residential within SPA (4) in accordance with Section 3.7 Shoreline 
Residential of this Plan and the following additional policies:
